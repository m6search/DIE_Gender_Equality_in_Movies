# DIE_Gender_Equality_in_Movies
Data-Intensive Engineering Two Semesters Project

## The Movie Database

### PDF
- The very row data that we use
- The pdf versions of the scripts of the movies that we use for our project.

### HTML
- Converted HTML versions of the PDF files. 
- Since it is not possible to work with PDFs directly, they are converted into parseable HTML format.

### JSON
- We create two types of JSON files
- One is for dialogues and the other one is for the scenarios.

### CSV
- CSV files are easily readable by Pandas Framework we use
- We keep dialogues of characters and also their gender information in CSV files.

## Processed DB

Contains our final CSV files, all_characters.csv is for all the character information from all over the movies that we use and all_movies_emotions.csv is all the processed data (all emotion scores of all the dialogues)

## Codes

### StepByStep Conversion
- Shows how we convert the data into different formats


### Clustering FinalDB
- Shows how we cluster the characters based on emotions

### Final Notebook
- Shows all the codebase we have in sections
