Hey?", " Thanks.  See ya.", " How the am I going to last a week?", " What are you doing here?", " Kate, you'd better go.  He's not going to like it if you're here.", " Of course we're friends.

You fucking bastard!", " You asshole.  I can't believe what a shit you are!", " I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!", " I almost picked up that fucking table and smashed it in your fucking face.  I almost did it!", " I want the money that you owe me and I'm getting out of here!", " I've been with stinking old men that made me want to puke, but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you do!  You make me feel dirty inside.", " YOU DON'T OWN ME!  I say when!  I say who!  I say how much!

What you did is wrong.", " I know enough business to know when someone is getting screwed.", " And that makes it okay, because you can buy people?

Thanks.", " What?", " What did he do?  Threatten you?  Give you a big tip?  Doesn't anyone have the nerve to stand up to him?  Don't say your sorry if you're not.

You're never gonna make it on the street.", " Yeah, we'll you'd better find a new place to live, cause I'm not going to\u2026", " That's the guy.  That's your guy.", " No, that's your guy.  He's looking for you.", " Go out there!  Go!  What do you want? For him to put up a billboard saying he's sorry?  What are you waiting for?"], "EDWARD": [" How do I get to Wilshire Boulevard?", " I'm lost.  How do I get to Wilshire?", " Actually, I just want directions.", " I can see that.  But perhaps you'd make an exception.", " A bargain.", " All I have is a twenty\u2026", " How do I get to Wilshire?", " You're a lovely young lady, but I'm not in the habit of picking up girls off the street.  Now\u2026", " You're a very persuasive woman. It happens that I am alone tonight\u2026", " A hundred dollars.  For the whole night?", " You're quite a negotiator.  Alright.  I can't believe I'm doing this, but climb in.", " It's rented.", " Edward.  What's your's?", " I'm staying in a hotel in Beverly Hills.", " New York.", " It's alright.  Are you going to tell me how to get to Wilshire?", " Business.", " You certainly ask a lot of questions.", " Listen, my overcoat's in the back seat. Why don't you put it on?", " Let's just say you're a little over\u2014 dressed for this hotel.", " It's not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.", " Perhaps so.  But if this hotel has any hookers, they don't look like they're\u2026", " Exactly.", " Penthouse.", " Room Service\u2026.  I'd like a bottle of the house champagne and a bowl of chilled strawberries sent to my room. Thank you.", " Nice view?", " I've impressed you?", " Very good.", " As I recall, you where the one that picked me up.", " It started to seem like a good idea.", " Cruising?  Hmmm.  Well, I don't get to drive a lot in New York, so I thought it would be interesting to tool around and admire some of the local architecture.  I was sightseeing the Chinese Theater when I got lost and ran into you\u2026", " That should be the champagne.", " That'll be fine.", " I think he wanted you to tip him.", " I'm afraid so.", " Both.  This is the house brand.  I didn't think you'd mind.", " More questions.  My wife divorced me years ago and is in Europe I believe, spending my money.  My girlfriend is in New York\u2026 spending my money.  Cheers.", " I wish I could.  But I've got a liver problem.  I can't have any alcohol.", " No.  I just like the smell.  Fond memories. How do you like it?", " No.  Not tobacco or otherwise.", " Try a strawberry.  It'll bring out the sweetness of the champagne.", " Better?", " I don't know.  Just being difficult.", " You put it very well.  I'm a professional man and I'd like to find a professional woman.  Any more questions?", " How about the bedroom?", " Oh\u2026 yes.", " I see.  I suppose you can't be too safe about that kind of thing.", " What are you doing?", " You could hang them in the closet.", " Hey.  Slow down.  I thought we had the whole night.", " Well, then I'm not like most guys.", " Sorry.  What do you like?", " I'm an incurable romantic.", " What are you doing?", " I thought we had all night.", " You did.  But stay the night.  I'd like to sleep with you.  I'll get you a taxi in the morning.", " Another question.  Because you're warm.", " I don't snore.  I don't believe I snore.", " That seems fair.", " Cindy, I've had it.  This is the third time I've had to take a trip alone.", " I don't care what your agent says.  One week isn't going to ruin your career.", " I want you here.  You know how I get when I'm doing business.  Last night I even\u2026 \u2026 forget last night.  I want you on a flight today or it's over.", " You promised me when you started this whole modeling thing that I would come first.  Now I'm still the one that's paying your bills and I'm not going to\u2026 Cindy!", " Stupid girl!  That's it\u2026", " You're quite a sleeper.", " Good morning.  Would you like some breakfast?", " That must be an occupational hazard.", " Would you like some breakfast?  It's still hot.", " You should.  Come on.", " Hair of the dog.", " Just a bit.  With orange juice.  I guarantee it will make you feel better.", " Don't you like anything?", " Well, you're welcome to take a nice long bath.  The one in the bathroom is practically a pool.", " I wanted to talk to you about that.", " Crepes.", " Vivian\u2026  It's Vivian, right?", " Vivian, I'm going to be in town until next Friday.  I'm involved in an important business deal and in the evenings I'll need to relax\u2026", " Hey, slow down.  I'm not going to take your plate away from you.", " Actually, I was wondering if you would like to stay here for the week.", " No, no, I'm not.  You're a very\u2026 professional woman.  And I like that. Rather than call you every night and wonder if you're available, I'd just as soon have you stay here.", " How much?  Let's see if I can afford it.", " Yes.  You can do what you want during the days, but I'd like to have you on call, so to speak.", " Alright.  That seems fair.  Two thousand it is.  But let me tell you, I have very tough business to do.  There is a lot of pressure involved.  When I get tense, I need someone to help me relax.  That means no problems.  No hassles. Understand?", " I'm not just talking about sex.  I need some nice pleasant company.", " Fine.  But I will go.  This is only for a week.  I want you to be clear on that too.  I don't want you to have any expectations.  Sometimes these things get messy.", " I wish my lawyer was that honest.  I wouldn't even risk this, except you seem a very sensible girl. Businesslike.  So it's a deal?", " No, I want you to stay here while you're with me.  I don't want any trouble.  We'll buy anything you need. What do you want?", " No.  No drugs.  Not while you're with me.", " Champagne is legal.  Drugs are illegal. That's enough of a difference to me.", " Then maybe this isn't going to work out.  I didn't know you were a drug addict.", " That's fair.  Three thousand dollars for one week, no drugs, no strings attached.", " Happy, huh?", " I'm overpaying you.  Aren't I?", " I don't think it will break me.", " Good.  I've got to meet with some people.  I'll probably be gone most of the day.", " I'm going to take a chance and trust you with this.  Buy some nice clothes on Rodeo Drive.  A few dresses, not too fancy, or too sexy.  Soft pinks and pastels are nice.  I just want you to look presentable in the hotel. Understand?", " Well, let's hope you don't spend that much.", " Be reasonable.  You're a smart girl. I'll make you a deal.  If you spend too much I'll send it all back at the end of the week.  If you're sensible, I'll let you keep it.  Fair?", " 'Bye.", " Then hold off until we file.", " No, no.  I always play by the rules. There are too many people that would like to take me down.  I'm not about to give them any help.", " Good to meet you.", " What's that long building over there?", " You what?", " What kind of idiot are you?  You don't talk to anyone about this but me!", " Where did you dig up this moron?", " You people are supposed to be professionals.", " No.  Don't bother.  He's probably already told everyone he knows.", " Forget it.  Let's go up the coast.  I want to look around.", " Bill!  Where the hell have you been?", " Good, if your boys at the brokerage don't leak the whole deal.", " Skip it.  Jake's going to be good from now on.  Aren't you?", " Listen, there's something you need to look into right away.  There's a chemical treatment plant at that shipyard.  I want you to see if the permits are still valid. And what kind of limits are on them.", " Don't get too excited yet.  Check the permits first.", " Thanks for the tour.  Keep your mouths shut.  I'll see you tomorrow.", " Ask them.  What's the offering looking like?", " That's madness.  If I start paying rates like that I'll be out of business.  We've going to have to do better than that.", " You're not listening to me.  We're going to do better than that.  Aren't we?", " No.  That's all over.  I've lost my patience with her.", " No, thanks.  I've already taken care of that side of my trip.  I met a pretty, no nonsense girl who's going to stay with me for the week.  She wants a third of what those pimps charge.", " No, I was driving around the city and I found a\u2026 girl.", " The girls you try to set me up with aren't virgins either, Bill.  I'm careful.", " Drop it.", " I don't need a girl who speaks French better than I do.  Those high class hookers are just high class leeches. I'm tired of them asking me to buy them jewels as tips.  I've found a nice, anonymous girl who's thrilled to provide me with sex at a fair rate with no hassles.  She's just a simple working girl and that's all I want.", " Any messages?", " Hello.", " My niece?", " I don't have a niece.", " That pretty young girl in my room is a prostitute.", " Do you have a problem with that?", " Have some champagne sent up.  And a cheese tray or something.  Maybe a p\u00e2te and some bread.  A large bottle of mineral water. And strawberries.", " You\u2026 you look different.", " No, it's just that you look\u2026 different.", " Yes.  Yes, I did.", " You had your hair done.", " No, no.  I'll pay for it.  You look wonderful.  Lovely.", " Yes.", " No, no, this is wonderful.  I just didn't think you\u2026  you have great taste.", " I do like it.  You look beautiful.", " Thank you.  That's much better. I had an interesting talk with the hotel manager downstairs.", " Listen to me.  I don't know what happened with you two, and I don't care.  I'm paying a lot for this room and as long as you're my guest, the people in this hotel will treat you like a queen.  If anyone hassles you, or makes you feel uncomfortable, you tell me.  Alright?  If I have to, I'll buy the hotel and burn it down to prove my point.", " You want me to have him fired?", " I'll see what I can do.  So did you buy anything else?", " Only three dresses?", " That's fine.  You were very frugal.", " New underwear too?", " Very much.", " That's Room Service.", " Cheers.", " The good stuff?", " Yes.", " It's okay, it's okay.  I don't care what you spent.  I trust you.", " Yes.  It's yours.", " Better.  You're a lot better.  You're wonderful, Vivian.", " Meet with lawyers and stockbrokers. Read financial reports.  It's pretty boring.", " I'm acquiring a company.", " It's called Kross Enterprises.  It used to build ships.  Nowadays it doesn't do much of anything.", " Are you really curious?", " All right.  Warn me if I bore you. Twenty years ago Kross was a huge corporation, and even though they're almost bankrupt today, they still have millions in assets.  Real estate, equipment, inventory.  Things that can be liquidated to generate cash.  You understand?", " Anyhow, we figure Kross is worth about 400 million.  We hope we can acquire it for between two and three hundred million.  No matter what, I'm going to make a profit.  The question is how large.", " Try is the key word there.  People have tried.  But not everyone can raise a few hundred million to toy around with .  And I know of assets the corporation owns that other people aren't aware of. It's worth more than most people think. Besides, the company management isn't particularly happy about being sold, because they'd be out of a job.", " I wouldn't lose any sleep over them. They got the corporation into the mess it's in now.", " Something like that.", " It used to be easy.  The market crash and a few scandals have made things tougher.  And management has got smarter.  I have to be more careful about my targets now.", " I guess\u2026 to get richer. I'm going to have to get dressed, I have a meeting at eight fifteen. Tomorrow I'll give you a lesson on short selling.", " You're a good listener.  I like that.", " How do I look?", " Like a suit?  Very apt.  I feel like a suit.  I'll see you tonight.", " It's not acceptable.", " Draymen Heux has offered me seventy- five in the pool at sixteen and a half. I can secure the rest I need personally.", " The market has changed, Carl.  There aren't many real players left.  I'll give you two hours to make a decision.", " They can't know for sure.  They don't have time.  They'll do it for sixteen.", " About what?", " Alright.", " I wouldn't miss it for the world.", " No.  If the three of us sit down together then we might as well announce the takeover in the Wall Street Journal.  I'll meet him in public for dinner.  Less suspicious.  Tonight, if you can arrange it.  I'll even bring a girl.  That'll keep it all on a friendly level.", " She can handle herself.  And I can handle Kross.", " Sixteen.", " We'll liven things up for you.  We're going out to dinner tonight.  I want you to look your best.  I don't think you have any clothes that will do.  Go buy something a little more formal.  Something dark and low cut.  But tasteful.  Spend whatever you have to.  If you don't know what to get, tell the salesgirl you're dining at the Rex.  And have your hair done up.  We're a little pushed for time so I'll meet you in the lobby at seven forty\u2014five.  'Bye.", " Then call the S.E.C.", " Are you threatening me?", " Really, Mr. Kross.  I don't think we have anything to talk about.  Maybe you should see my lawyer.", " Let's go, Vivian.", " Are you sure, Viv?", " I didn't have to come here.  I don't have to talk to you.  If you have something to say you better say it without threatening me or insulting the lady.", " I really don't know.  But from what I've heard, your company doesn't have any cash.", " Then I'd be in a position of making your company a loan.  That doesn't seem to make much sense.", " Mr. Kross, you're not going to be getting any Navy contracts.", " Just that.  You're not going to be getting any new contracts from the military.  I know.", " You flatter me if you think I can tell the Pentagon what to do.  But I do know you aren't getting the contract.", " Now let me propose something to you.  If I do decide to acquire your company, I will file the proper papers with the S.E.C.  If that was to happen, I would suggest that you and the Board cooperate with me, rather than try to fight it.  You couldn't stop me, you could only lower my profit margin.  If you don't fight me, you'll find I can be a valuable friend.", " It's not your company.  It's a public company.  We both know that you can only keep it going for a couple more years before you get swallowed up by debt.", " Yes?", " Now it's my turn to apologize.  I'm afraid that I have a private call that I must deal with.  If I may be excused\u2026", " My apologies again.", " At least stay for dinner.", " Which is?", " If you feel that way, do what you have to do.  But if you change your mind, come to me.  My door will be open.", " You and your fork.  You were such a picture.", " Yes.  Yes, but just for two.", " Of course.", " That's Cindy.", " She's very little.  Just over five feet.  But she's got the best body. It's perfect, and her face\u2026 you can see.", " Dumber than a doornail, though.  I guess they beat the intelligence out of you in finishing school.", " Cindy?  No.  That's over.  She was too much trouble.  I don't have time to play games with women.", " We were right, they don't have any cash.  The only card he had was the Navy contract and we know what happened to that.", " Well, that's your job.", " Do some research.  The guy used to be a millionaire.  Where's he get his money these days?  What banks are loaning it to him?  Find out.  We have lots of friends.  It wouldn't take much.  A couple phone calls.", " Are those real?", " They look lovely.", " Now you're thinking.  Get on it.  We're going to wrap this up by Friday.  I know it now.  Talk to you tomorrow.", " Have I ever told you how very, very beautiful you are?  You are, you know. Very beautiful.", " I certainly could have done a lot worse for a wrong turn on Hollywood Boulevard.", " Easy, doll.  You're supposed to sip it.", " Makes what easier?", " I don't think you need anymore.  You're already drunk.", " What's wrong with you?  You've been acting strange all evening.  Are you mad at me?", " Fine, then come here and get it over with.", " What is this?  What's the matter with you?  Last night you weren't complaining.  You weren't trying to rush through it.  Last night you seemed to like it.", " You didn't feel anything?  Nothing? You don't ever enjoy making love?", " Why not?  I think I've been pretty good to you the last few days.  Haven't I treated you well?", " Then what is it?  Am I ugly to you?  Am I fat and disgusting?  Do I smell bad? People have been so bold as to tell me I'm somewhat attractive.  Aren't I to you?", " Then why are you in such a rush to get it over with?  Why do you have to get drunk?  Is it really that horrible? I'm not asking you to love me.  I'm not even asking you to like me.", " Fine.  Don't like me.  But don't lie to me.  Maybe you hate me now for some reason that I can't fathom, but you enjoyed it last night as much as I did.", " Tell me the truth!", " You're lieing!", " Too late.", " You didn't enjoy that?", " Alright.  Then just do your job.", " What are you doing?", " Why do you always have to take a shower after we make love?", " What are you doing?", " Why don't you sit on the couch, or go back to bed?  Don't you feel alright?", " No wonder, the way you were drinking last night. You were great though.  You're an incredible lover.", " I hope you feel better.  I'll be gone all day.  Maybe we'll have dinner someplace nice tonight.", " Flight of fancy.  Let's offer eight.  That should bring them back down to earth.  Then we'll raise it to nine and close the deal.", " Yes.  Time to jump out of the closet.", " Black.", " So, tell me about Kross.", " Bank we know?", " Need me to call anyone?", " I will.", " So why don't we go to dinner tonight? You can meet this girl I've been talking about.", " She's incredible.  In every way.", " Tell Bill what you said to me, that first night. It was something like \"if you're looking for romance you were cruising down the wrong street.  But if you want to fuck, you've found the best\u2026\" Was that how it went?", " What difference does it make where I found her?  I think she's great.  She's a lot smarter and prettier and better in bed than those girls at your friend's agency.  They cost an arm and a leg and they're cold as ice.  But everytime I get into town you try to push another of their girls on me.  Why is that, Bill?  Do you own a piece of that business?", " What are you thinking about, Bill?", " You want her, don't you?", " You're drooling, Bill.", " She's the best.  But you'll have to wear a condom.  She's careful about that.", " North American Steel.", " Why not?", " My, you're quiet.  You haven't said a word to me since we left the restaurant.  I kind of like it, but\u2026", " Have you lost your mind?!", " Would you please tell me what you're mad about?", " Alright.  Just calm down.", " I'm sorry.  It was a stupid joke.  I wasn't serious\u2026.", " Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?", " I\u2026 I wasn't serious.  It was just a joke.  I was razzing Bill because he runs this call girl service.  We tease each other like that.  He brings out the worst locker room talk from me. But I didn't think you'd mind my saying\u2026 I mean, it's not as if you're from a convent.  You tell me yourself it's just a job to you.", " Of course.  You're right.  I'm sorry.", " Vivian, I'm very sorry.  You're absolutely right.  That was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I can tell that you have a lot of pride and I should have known that that would hurt you.", " Alright.  I've apologized.  I've said I'm sorry.  Now if you want to take what you've earned so far and walk out of here, I'll understand.", " Do you want me to call a cab?", " Do you?", " Then think about it.  I've apologized. I've heard what you have to say. You're right, and it won't happen again.  But if you can't get over this then you should leave, because I'm only going to be here a couple more days and I'm not going to spend it fighting with you.  Understand?", " Alright.  I'll call a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.", " I'm sorry.  I really am sorry.", " I've been a fiendish cad, and I'll make it up to you.", " Because I was a boor, a clod, an oaf, a cretin, a dunce, a putz, a shmuck\u2026", " \u2026but I shall make amends as only a Harris can.", " I shall give you an experience that will last a lifetime.", " I'm going to take you to the opera.", " That's it.  That's what you're wearing tonight.", " She'll wear it out.  I'm taking her to A\u00efda in San Francisco tonight.", " Feel like Cinderella yet?", " Bill, Bill, stop panicking.  I'll read the contracts on the plane.  Just have the brokerage arrange the flight for me.  Kross isn't going anywhere.  I don't need to watch the stock go down today.  Have it ready.  I'll make a couple more stops and be there in an hour or two.  'Bye.", " My empire may crumble through neglect, but it's worth it.  I've been meaning to see A\u00efda before it closes and now I have a good excuse.  But you must be freezing in that skimpy thing.", " No, no.  You're bound to catch pneumonia if we don't do something.", " Nice, but not what I had in mind.  I'm looking for something really special.", " Vivian, trust me, I know furs.  I'm going to find you one that will give you multiple orgasms.", " Yes.", " I'm glad you're having fun.  Now be quiet while I read these.", " Go away.", " What are you doing?", " You'd better put on your clothes.", " You sure make it hard to concentrate on my work.", " Some people say that opera is an acquired taste \u2014\u2014 that's why everyone prefers movies \u2014\u2014 but I don't believe it.  It's something you're born to.  But I don't mean that in an elitist sense.  Highborn, lowborn, you can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  Some love it, some hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might force themselves to appreciate it, but they'll never love it.  Maybe there's an opera gene in a person's DNA.", " So am I.", " I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story for you.  But you'll be surprised at how much you'll understand by the way they sing.  The music conveys their emotions more powerfully than any words.", " Radames is desperately in love with A\u00efda, a mere slave.  Yet he is forced to marry Amneris, the King's daughter.", " Here he tells A\u00efda how much loves her but\u2026", " Are you alright.  Can you make it down the stairs?", " You liked the opera, didn't you?", " Yes, two more nights.", " No\u2026 I have to get back to New York. I've got appointments waiting for me.", " It was a pleasure.  You're welcome.", " What's the matter?", " Oh.", " I'm sorry if it's hard on you.", " Sure.  Let me call \u2014\u2014", " Okay.  Order anything you want.", " You're such an operator.", " Alright.  Tell him ten\u2014thirty.", " Wake up, sleeping beauty.", " Put on some clothes.  We're about to have a guest.", " Mr. Kross.", " Have a seat.", " Excellent.  I'm sure that will be the best for everyone.", " There is nothing to apologize for. It's just business.", " I appreciate that.  And I'm sure things will go well for you.", " Perhaps you could do me one favor though.  If you could take an hour to accompany me down to my brokerage and have a brief talk with my lawyer.  Just answer a couple questions.", " Let me be completely up front with you, Mr. Kross.  We're preparing our bid now.  That bid is based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The more we know the higher our bid can be.  That might affect the deal we have for your shares\u2026", " It doesn't have to be that way.", " Good.  Vivian \u2014\u2014", " Excuse me for one second.", " I'm going to be gone all day.  I don't think I'll be back in time for dinner so go ahead and eat.  Alright?", " Why'd you run off?", " I\u2026 I didn't do anything to him.", " He just realised that it would be smart to let me buy him out before his company went under.  Noboby put a gun to his head.", " Wrong?  Vivian, this is a very complex transaction.  There's no right and wrong here.  You don't know anything about this kind of business.", " What?  You think Kross is some kind of martyr?  We didn't threatten him; we bought him.  He's selling out everyone at his company to get an extra dollar a share.", " I'm getting a lecture on ethics from a prostitute.", " I don't have time for this.  If you don't like it, you're free to go.  No one's holding you prisoner.", " Everything's fine.  Let's go.", " Hmm?", " I don't know.", " I just thought I'd look at the shipyards again.  Before I go back to New York.", " Would you like to come with me?", " You can always Fedex it later.", " Yes, a few things.  Not all what we wanted to hear, but\u2026", " But\u2026 it's not important.  Let's head back.", " Cut it out!  What's going on?!", " What the hell are you doing?", " Why were you hitting her?", " Get out of here.", " You alright?", " No one's going to hit you anymore.", " I'm sorry.", " You didn't do anything wrong.  You don't have to go.", " Viv, I'm sorry what he did.  But I want you to know I had nothing to do with it.", " Alright.  I understand.", " Here.  I was going to give you this tomorrow, but I'll give it to you now. It's three thousand.", " That's crazy.  Take it.  You need it. You earned it.", " Vivian, please, don't make this hard.", " Vivian, stay.  Please stay.", " So did you.  I'm not sure I like my own reflection. Stay with me.", " I'll sleep on the couch.

Let's think this thing through.", " Then take the money.", " What is this?  What was last night all about?  Do you really want to go?", " What do you want from me?

Some of the richest people I've met have the worst manners.

Much more than you can make on the street.", " You've got a mean streak in you.  Don't you?  Maybe that's what Edward liked about you.", " There's nothing to get hostile about. I have some friends who run a nice service.  They aren't like the pimps you find on the street.  They don't muscle you.  They just help you.  Sure, they take a cut, but since you're making a lot more money you won't even think about it.", " How long have you been on the street, Vivian?", " I figured something like that.  You act tough but you don't have a clue as to where you're going.  You're still fresh off the bus from the cornfields.

They did it because they knew damn well no one could build anything better!  We built this country into the greatest industrial power the world has ever known.  We creamed the Japanese!  We dwarfed the rest of the world.  Dwarfed! This country sent men to the moon! But something happened\u2026", " We made mistakes, maybe.  I don't know.
