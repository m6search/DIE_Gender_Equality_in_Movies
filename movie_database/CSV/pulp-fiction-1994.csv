YOUNG MAN," No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.",male
YOUNG MAN," I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but -",male
YOUNG MAN," - yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.",male
YOUNG MAN," I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.",male
YOUNG MAN," Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.",male
YOUNG MAN, Correct. I got all tonight to quack.,male
YOUNG MAN, I'm doin' fine.,male
YOUNG MAN," I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: ""We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er.""",male
YOUNG MAN," Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.",male
YOUNG MAN, I don't know. There probably never was a little girl - the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.,male
YOUNG MAN," I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.",male
YOUNG MAN," Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.",male
YOUNG MAN," What have we been talking about? Yeah, no- more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: ""Empty out the register,"" and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.",male
YOUNG MAN," I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.",male
YOUNG MAN, Not this life.,male
YOUNG MAN, Garcon! Coffee!,male
YOUNG MAN, This place.,male
YOUNG MAN," What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.",male
YOUNG MAN," Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelette, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.",male
YOUNG MAN," See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?",male
YOUNG MAN, They you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.,male
YOUNG MAN, That was a good idea.,male
YOUNG MAN, We made more from the wallets then we did the register.,male
YOUNG MAN, A lot of people go to restaurants.,male
YOUNG MAN," Pretty smart, huh?",male
YOUNG MAN," Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.",male
YOUNG MAN," I love you, Honey Bunny.",male
YOUNG WOMAN," You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.",female
YOUNG WOMAN, - but you forget about it in a day or two -,female
YOUNG WOMAN," When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?",female
YOUNG WOMAN," You sound like a duck. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...",female
YOUNG WOMAN, After tonight.,female
YOUNG WOMAN," Oh yes, thank you.",female
YOUNG WOMAN, Did it work?,female
YOUNG WOMAN, Did they hurt the little girl?,female
YOUNG WOMAN, You wanna rob banks?,female
YOUNG WOMAN, So you don't want to be a bank robber?,female
YOUNG WOMAN, And no more liquor stores?,female
YOUNG WOMAN, I'm not gonna kill anybody.,female
YOUNG WOMAN," Well, what else is there, day jobs?",female
YOUNG WOMAN, Well what then?,female
YOUNG WOMAN, Here? It's a coffee shop.,female
YOUNG WOMAN, I bet in places like this you couldcut down on the hero factor.,female
YOUNG WOMAN, Yeah.,female
YOUNG WOMAN, Uh-huh.,female
YOUNG WOMAN, Thanks.,female
YOUNG WOMAN, Yes we did.,female
YOUNG WOMAN, A lot of wallets.,female
YOUNG WOMAN," Pretty smart. I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.",female
YOUNG WOMAN, Got it.,female
YOUNG WOMAN," I love you, Pumpkin.",female
PUMPKIN, Everybody be cool this is a robbery!,male
PUMPKIN," Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!",male
PUMPKIN," Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.",male
PUMPKIN," You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! Asta luego!",male
PUMPKIN," On the floor or I'll cook you ass, comprende?",male
PUMPKIN, You're gonna give me a problem?,male
PUMPKIN, What? You said you're gonna give me a problem?,male
PUMPKIN," I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!",male
PUMPKIN, Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.,male
PUMPKIN," Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.",male
PUMPKIN," Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?",male
PUMPKIN, In the bag.,male
PUMPKIN, What's in that?,male
PUMPKIN, You boss makes you do his laundry?,male
PUMPKIN, Sounds like a shit job.,male
PUMPKIN, Open it up.,male
PUMPKIN, I didn't hear you.,male
PUMPKIN, Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.,male
PUMPKIN," You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.",male
PUMPKIN," I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One...",male
PUMPKIN, ... two... three.,male
PUMPKIN, Open it.,male
PUMPKIN, Is that what I think it is?,male
PUMPKIN, It's beautiful.,male
PUMPKIN," Chill out, honey!",male
PUMPKIN, I'm gonna be okay.,male
PUMPKIN, I promise.,male
PUMPKIN, Just chill out.,male
PUMPKIN, Yolanda.,male
PUMPKIN," It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool.",male
PUMPKIN, Which one is it?,male
PUMPKIN, About fifteen hundred dollars.,male
PUMPKIN, What?,male
PUMPKIN, Not regularly.,male
HONEY BUNNY, Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?,female
HONEY BUNNY, Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?!,female
HONEY BUNNY," Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!",female
HONEY BUNNY, Don't take any chances. Execute him!,female
HONEY BUNNY, What's goin' on?,female
HONEY BUNNY, Shoot 'em in the face!,female
HONEY BUNNY, What is it? What is it?,female
HONEY BUNNY," Goddammit, what is it?",female
HONEY BUNNY," Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!",female
HONEY BUNNY, Let him go!,female
JULES," - Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?",male
JULES," Well, hash is legal there, right?",male
JULES, Those are hash bars?,male
JULES," That did it, man - I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.",male
JULES, What?,male
JULES, Examples?,male
JULES, They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?,male
JULES, What'd they call it?,male
JULES, Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?,male
JULES, Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?,male
JULES, What?,male
JULES, Goddamn!,male
JULES, Uuccch!,male
JULES, We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.,male
JULES, Three or four.,male
JULES, I'm not sure.,male
JULES, It's possible.,male
JULES, Mia.,male
JULES," I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.",male
JULES, I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.,male
JULES," Well, you know the shows on TV?",male
JULES," Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?",male
JULES," Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.",male
JULES," You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.",male
JULES," I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.",male
JULES," Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.",male
JULES," No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.",male
JULES, He gave her a foot massage.,male
JULES," Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses - nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.",male
JULES, Whaddya mean?,male
JULES, You don't think he overreacted?,male
JULES," It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.",male
JULES," It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit.",male
JULES, Don't be tellin' me about foot massages - I'm the foot fuckin' master.,male
JULES," Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.",male
JULES, Fuck you.,male
JULES, Fuck you.,male
JULES," Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed - this is the door.",male
JULES, What time is it?,male
JULES," It ain't quite time, let's hang back.",male
JULES," Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass-motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.",male
JULES," That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.",male
JULES, Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?,male
JULES, Take care of her?,male
JULES, You're gonna be takin'MIA Wallace out on a date?,male
JULES, Hey kids.,male
JULES, How you boys doin'?,male
JULES," Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.",male
JULES, Do you know who we are?,male
JULES," We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?",male
JULES," Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?",male
JULES," I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?",male
JULES," Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?",male
JULES, Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?,male
JULES," No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, where?",male
JULES," Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?",male
JULES, Mind if I try one of yours?,male
JULES," Yours is this one, right?",male
JULES," Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?",male
JULES," You wanna bite, they're real good.",male
JULES," Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?",male
JULES," Tell 'em, Vincent.",male
JULES," Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?",male
JULES," Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. What's in this?",male
JULES," Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?",male
JULES," Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?",male
JULES," Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.",male
JULES, - I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing. You were sayin'?,male
JULES, We happy?,male
JULES, Vincent!,male
JULES, We happy?,male
JULES," My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit.",male
JULES," Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about ""best intentions.""",male
JULES," Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?",male
JULES, What country you from!,male
JULES," ""What"" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in ""What?""",male
JULES, English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-it?,male
JULES, Then you understand what I'm sayin'?,male
JULES, Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!,male
JULES," Say ""What"" again! C'mon, say ""What"" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say ""What"" one more goddamn time!",male
JULES, Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!,male
JULES, - go on!,male
JULES, - does he look like a bitch?!,male
JULES, Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!,male
JULES, Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!,male
JULES," Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?",male
JULES," There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.""",male
JULES, We should be fuckin' dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.,male
JULES, We should be fuckin' dead!,male
JULES, That shit wasn't luck. That shit was somethin' else.,male
JULES, That was... divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?,male
JULES," Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.",male
JULES, Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!,male
JULES," Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.",male
JULES," We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!",male
JULES," If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.",male
JULES," That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.",male
JULES, Don't blaspheme!,male
JULES, - I said don't do that -,male
JULES, I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.,male
JULES," Don't worry, I will.",male
JULES, I don't give a damn if he does.,male
JULES, What the fuck's happening?,male
JULES, Why the fuck did you do that?,male
JULES, I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time -,male
JULES, The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!,male
JULES, Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight -,male
JULES," Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood.",male
JULES," This is the Valley,Vincent. Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley.",male
JULES, A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.,male
JULES," On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.",male
JULES, We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.,male
JULES," Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.",male
JULES," Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.",male
JULES, What the fuck did you just do to his towel? VINCENT I was just dryin' my hands.,male
JULES, You're supposed to wash 'em first.,male
JULES, I watched you get 'em wet.,male
JULES," I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.",male
JULES," Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him.",male
JULES," Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?",male
JULES, What?,male
JULES, Jimmie -,male
JULES," Naw man, I didn't.",male
JULES, Why?,male
JULES, Jimmie -,male
JULES," That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit,We just need to call our people to bring us in.",male
JULES," You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.",male
JULES," I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ""ifs.""What I wanna hear from your ass is: ""you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly.""",male
JULES, You sendin' The Wolf?,male
JULES," Shit Negro, that's all you had to say.",male
JULES," Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.",male
JULES," Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.",male
JULES," It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.",male
JULES, I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!,male
JULES," Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.",male
JULES," You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm ""SUPERFLY T.N.T,"" I'm the ""GUNS OF NAVARONE."" I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.",male
JULES, This morning air is some chilly shit.,male
JULES," Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.",male
JULES," Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!",male
JULES," Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.",male
JULES," Yeah, well, out asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is.",male
JULES, Don't do shit unless -,male
JULES, Unless you do it first.,male
JULES, We cool?,male
JULES," Inglewood. It's your future: I see... a cab ride. Sorry guys, move out of the sticks. Say goodbye, Raquel",male
JULES, Mr. Wolf.,male
JULES, I was a pleasure watchin' you work.,male
JULES, Wanna share a cab?,male
JULES, Sure.,male
JULES," Naw, I don't eat pork.",male
JULES," I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine.",male
JULES, They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.,male
JULES," A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.",male
JULES, I don't eat dog either.,male
JULES," I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And  personality goes a long way.",male
JULES, We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.,male
JULES, I just been sittin' here thinkin'.,male
JULES, The miracle we witnessed.,male
JULES, Do you know that a miracle is?,male
JULES, What's an act of God?,male
JULES," Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.",male
JULES, That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.,male
JULES," The life, most definitely.",male
JULES," That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.",male
JULES," You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU."" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.",male
JULES, Until God puts me where he want me to be.,male
JULES," If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.",male
JULES," I'll just be Jules, Vincent - no more, no less.",male
JULES," Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ -",male
JULES," All shapes and sizes, Vince.",male
JULES," If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.",male
JULES, My boss' dirty laundry.,male
JULES, When he wants it clean.,male
JULES," Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.",male
JULES, 'Fraid I can't do that.,male
JULES," Yes, you did.",male
JULES," I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.",male
JULES," Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!",male
JULES, You win.,male
JULES," It's all yours, Ringo.",male
JULES," Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!",male
JULES, Tell her it's gonna be okay.,male
JULES, Promise her.,male
JULES, Tell her to chill.,male
JULES, What's her name?,male
JULES," So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?",male
JULES, Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?,male
JULES," C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?",male
JULES," Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool. Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?",male
JULES, One... two... three.,male
JULES," Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.",male
JULES," That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do. Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you  appened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.",male
JULES," It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'. Tell her we're still cool.",male
JULES, Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.,male
JULES," Yolanda, how we doin, baby?",male
JULES," Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great,Ringo's proud of you and so am I. It's almost over. Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.",male
JULES, It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.,male
JULES, That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?,male
JULES," Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.",male
JULES," You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?",male
JULES, Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?,male
JULES," There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.""I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold- blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.",male
JULES, It's cold.,male
JULES, That's probably a good idea.,male
VINCENT, What so you want to know?,male
VINCENT," Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.",male
VINCENT," Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause - get a load of this - if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.",male
VINCENT, You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?,male
VINCENT," It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.",male
VINCENT," Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?",male
VINCENT," No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.",male
VINCENT, Royale with Cheese.,male
VINCENT," Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.",male
VINCENT," I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?",male
VINCENT, Mayonnaise.,male
VINCENT," I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.",male
VINCENT, How many up there?,male
VINCENT, Counting our guy?,male
VINCENT, So there could be five guys up there?,male
VINCENT, We should have fuckin' shotguns.,male
VINCENT, What's her name?,male
VINCENT, How did Marsellus and her meet?,male
VINCENT, She ever do anything I woulda saw?,male
VINCENT, What's a pilot?,male
VINCENT, I don't watch TV.,male
VINCENT, Yeah.,male
VINCENT," Yeah maybe, fat right?",male
VINCENT," I think I know who you mean, what about him?",male
VINCENT," What'd he do, fuck her?",male
VINCENT, Well what then?,male
VINCENT, A foot massage?,male
VINCENT, That's all?,male
VINCENT, What did Marsellus do?,male
VINCENT, That's a damn shame.,male
VINCENT," Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.",male
VINCENT, You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.,male
VINCENT," Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.",male
VINCENT," It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out - no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark. JULES Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.",male
VINCENT," Not the same thing, the same ballpark.",male
VINCENT, Have you ever given a foot massage?,male
VINCENT, Given a lot of 'em?,male
VINCENT, Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?,male
VINCENT, How many?,male
VINCENT, Would you give me a foot massage - I'm kinda tired.,male
VINCENT, Seven-twenty-two in the morning.,male
VINCENT," I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin'Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.",male
VINCENT, What's her name again?,male
VINCENT," Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.",male
VINCENT, Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.,male
VINCENT, It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.,male
VINCENT, It's not a date.,male
VINCENT, No.,male
VINCENT, I ain't hungry.,male
VINCENT, Royale with Cheese.,male
VINCENT, Got it.,male
VINCENT, We're happy.,male
VINCENT, Where's the big man?,male
VINCENT, How 'bout a cup of just plain ol' American?,male
VINCENT, At Marsellus' request. ENGLISH DAVE Have you met Mia?,male
VINCENT, Not yet.,male
VINCENT, What's so funny?,male
VINCENT," Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.",male
VINCENT," I ain't your friend, palooka.",male
VINCENT," I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.",male
VINCENT," Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?",male
VINCENT," Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.",male
VINCENT, That's a bold statement.,male
VINCENT," Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand.",male
VINCENT, Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?,male
VINCENT, I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?,male
VINCENT, You don't mind if I shoot up here?,male
VINCENT, Mucho gracias.,male
VINCENT, You know what some fucker did to it the other day?,male
VINCENT, Fuckin' keyed it.,male
VINCENT," Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days - five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it.",male
VINCENT," I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?",male
VINCENT, Hello?,male
VINCENT, Hello.,male
VINCENT, Hello.,male
VINCENT, Okay.,male
VINCENT, What the fuck is this place?,male
VINCENT," Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.",male
VINCENT," After you, kitty-cat.",male
VINCENT, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.,male
VINCENT," Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke. BUDDY How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?",male
VINCENT, Did you just order a five-dollar shake?,male
VINCENT, A shake? Milk and ice cream?,male
VINCENT, It costs five dollars?,male
VINCENT, You don't put bourbon in it or anything?,male
VINCENT, Just checking.,male
VINCENT, It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.,male
VINCENT, Rollin' a smoke.,male
VINCENT, It's just tobacco.,male
VINCENT," You can have his one, cowgirl.",male
VINCENT, Think nothing of it.,male
VINCENT, Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.,male
VINCENT, What was it?,male
VINCENT, What?,male
VINCENT, What was your specialty?,male
VINCENT, Do you remember any of the jokes?,male
VINCENT, Tell me.,male
VINCENT," C'mon, don't be that way.",male
VINCENT, You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.,male
VINCENT, That's not what I meant and you know it.,male
VINCENT, I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.,male
VINCENT, What a gyp.,male
VINCENT, Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.,male
VINCENT," Yeah, but maybe I do.",male
VINCENT, milk shake.,male
VINCENT," I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'  good.",male
VINCENT, What?,male
VINCENT, I don't know.,male
VINCENT," I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.",male
VINCENT, I'll do that.,male
VINCENT, We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.,male
VINCENT, No there's not.,male
VINCENT, That's Marilyn Monroe...,male
VINCENT," ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.",male
VINCENT, I have moments.,male
VINCENT," Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.",male
VINCENT, Only if you promise not to get offended.,male
VINCENT, Then let's just forget it.,male
VINCENT, Is that a fact?,male
VINCENT, What do you think about what happened to Antwan?,male
VINCENT, Tony Rocky Horror.,male
VINCENT," That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.",male
VINCENT," No it's not, it's just what I heard.",male
VINCENT, They.,male
VINCENT, They certainly do.,male
VINCENT, No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.,male
VINCENT," No and, that's it.",male
VINCENT, Yeah.,male
VINCENT," At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.",male
VINCENT," No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.",male
VINCENT, But did it happen?,male
VINCENT," No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.",male
VINCENT, All right.,male
VINCENT," All right, you asked for it.",male
VINCENT, Was than an uncomfortable silence?,male
VINCENT, I'm gonna take a piss.,male
VINCENT," One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.",male
VINCENT," ... It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.",male
VINCENT," So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say ""Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening,"" go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.",male
VINCENT, Jesus Christ!,male
VINCENT, Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?,male
VINCENT," I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?",male
VINCENT," Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.",male
VINCENT," We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.",male
VINCENT," Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.",male
VINCENT, You still got an adrenalin shot?,male
VINCENT," I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin' ODing on me.",male
VINCENT, No choice.,male
VINCENT, Yeah. She's dyin'.,male
VINCENT, Negative.,male
VINCENT, Sorry.,male
VINCENT," Too late, I'm already here.",male
VINCENT," If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!",male
VINCENT," This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.",male
VINCENT, She's ODing on us.,male
VINCENT, You two are a match made in heaven.,male
VINCENT, What do you need a medical book for?,male
VINCENT, You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?,male
VINCENT, Well then get it.,male
VINCENT, I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.,male
VINCENT, Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!,male
VINCENT, Does it have to be exact?,male
VINCENT," Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.",male
VINCENT," I need a big fat magic marker, got one?",male
VINCENT," I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great.",male
VINCENT, You're gonna give her the shot.,male
VINCENT, I've never does this before.,male
VINCENT," Okay, what do I do?",male
VINCENT, I gotta stab her?,male
VINCENT, What happens after that?,male
VINCENT, This ain't a fuckin' joke man!,male
VINCENT, Count to three.,male
VINCENT, What are your thoughts on how to handle this?,male
VINCENT, Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.,male
VINCENT, I seriously doubt that.,male
VINCENT, Let's shake on it.,male
VINCENT, Mum's the word.,male
VINCENT," If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.",male
VINCENT," Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.",male
VINCENT, I can't wait.,male
VINCENT, Mia. How you doin'?,male
VINCENT, Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?,male
VINCENT, .357.,male
VINCENT," Yeah, we were lucky.",male
VINCENT," Yeah, maybe.",male
VINCENT," Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.",male
VINCENT, I think we should be going now.,male
VINCENT," Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.",male
VINCENT," Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?",male
VINCENT," Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?",male
VINCENT," ... Ever seen that show ""COPS?""I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens.",male
VINCENT, What the fuck does that mean?,male
VINCENT, Jesus Christ!,male
VINCENT," Goddammit, Jules -",male
VINCENT, - you're fuckin' freakin' out!,male
VINCENT," While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why.",male
VINCENT," I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.",male
VINCENT," Marvin, what do you make of all this?",male
VINCENT," C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?",male
VINCENT, I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.,male
VINCENT, I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.,male
VINCENT," - chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off.",male
VINCENT," Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-of- a-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how!",male
VINCENT," - I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter.",male
VINCENT, Can't we just take it to a friendly place?,male
VINCENT," Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules.",male
VINCENT, Who ya callin'?,male
VINCENT, Where's Toluca Lake.,male
VINCENT," If he kicks us out, whadda we do?",male
VINCENT, Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.,male
VINCENT," If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.",male
VINCENT, You watched me wash 'em.,male
VINCENT," I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.",male
VINCENT," A ""please"" would be nice.",male
VINCENT," I said a ""please"" would be nice.",male
VINCENT, I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.,male
VINCENT," Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?",male
VINCENT," I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.",male
VINCENT, All the way?,male
VINCENT, Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?,male
VINCENT, What?,male
VINCENT," I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.",male
VINCENT, Redondo Beach.,male
VINCENT, You know I could go for some breakfast. What to have breakfast with me?,male
VINCENT, Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?,male
VINCENT, Are you Jewish?,male
VINCENT, Why not?,male
VINCENT, Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.,male
VINCENT, How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.,male
VINCENT," Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?",male
VINCENT," So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?",male
VINCENT, Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.,male
VINCENT, About what?,male
VINCENT, The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.,male
VINCENT, An act of God.,male
VINCENT," I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.",male
VINCENT, But why?,male
VINCENT," So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?",male
VINCENT," So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?",male
VINCENT," What do you mean, walk the earth?",male
VINCENT, How long do you intend to walk the earth?,male
VINCENT, What if he never does?,male
VINCENT, So you decided to be a bum?,male
VINCENT," No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be - a fuckin' bum!",male
VINCENT, - what happened was peculiar - no doubt about it - but it wasn't water into wine.,male
VINCENT, Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!,male
VINCENT, I gotta take a shit. To be continued.,male
VINCENT," What the hell's goin' on, Jules?",male
VINCENT, Check.,male
VINCENT," Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.",male
VINCENT, I think we oughta leave now.,male
BRETT, We're doin' okay.,male
BRETT, I'm Brett.,male
BRETT, I remember him.,male
BRETT, Hamburgers.,male
BRETT, Cheeseburgers.,male
BRETT, Big Kahuna Burger.,male
BRETT, They're good.,male
BRETT, No.,male
BRETT, Yeah.,male
BRETT, No.,male
BRETT, Because of the metric system?,male
BRETT, Sprite.,male
BRETT, Sure.,male
BRETT," Look, what's your name? I got his name'sVINCENT, but what's yours?",male
BRETT," I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace. When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions -",male
BRETT, What?,male
BRETT, What?,male
BRETT, Yes.,male
BRETT, Yes.,male
BRETT, What?,male
BRETT, Well he's... he's... black -,male
BRETT, ... and he's... he's... bald -,male
BRETT, What?,male
BRETT, No.,male
BRETT, I didn't.,male
BRETT, Yes.,male
MARSELLUS," I think you're gonna find - when all this shit is over and done - I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last. Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about. This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine. Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather-weight champion of the world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that.",male
MARSELLUS," Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps. Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, ""Marsellus Wallace was right.""",male
MARSELLUS," In the fifth, your ass goes down.",male
MARSELLUS, Say it!,male
MARSELLUS," Vincent Vega has entered the building, git your ass over here!",male
MARSELLUS, What'cha got?,male
MARSELLUS," I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.",male
MARSELLUS," Step aside, Butch.",male
BUTCH, I got no problem with that.,male
BUTCH," In the fifth, my ass goes down.",male
BUTCH, Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?,male
BUTCH, Non.,male
BUTCH," Lookin' at somethin', friend?",male
BUTCH, What was that?,male
BUTCH, I'm ready.,male
BUTCH," If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up.",male
BUTCH, Outta here.,male
BUTCH," Hey, how do I open the window back here?",male
BUTCH, What?,male
BUTCH, Whatever gave you that idea?,male
BUTCH, I'm him.,male
BUTCH, He's dead?,male
BUTCH," Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.",male
BUTCH, What does what feel like?,male
BUTCH, Are you some kinda weirdo?,male
BUTCH," Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, I'll give you an answer.",male
BUTCH, So...,male
BUTCH, ... Esmarelda Villalobos - is that Mexican?,male
BUTCH, It's a very pretty name.,male
BUTCH," That's one hell of a name you got there, sister.",male
BUTCH, Butch.,male
BUTCH," I'm an American, our names don't mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?",male
BUTCH," - I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead. Now I know he's dead, do you wanna know how I feel about it?",male
BUTCH, I don't feel the least little bit bad.,male
BUTCH," What's I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive. If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive. Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch. How many bookies you spread it around with? Eight? How long to collect? So by tomorrow evening, you'll have it all? Good news Scotty, real good news - I understand a few stragglers aside. Me an' Fabienne're gonna leave in the morning. It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it'll be on Tennessee time.",male
BUTCH," Fabienne my love, our adventure begins.",male
BUTCH, Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort.,male
BUTCH," Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?",male
BUTCH," Bon soir, Esmarelda.",male
BUTCH," Is that better, sugar pop?",male
BUTCH, Pretty hard. I got into a fight.,male
BUTCH, Uh-huh?,male
BUTCH, You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?,male
BUTCH," Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.",male
BUTCH, I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.,male
BUTCH, You want me to have a pot?,male
BUTCH, You think guys would find that attractive?,male
BUTCH," If I had a pot belly, I'd punch you in it.",male
BUTCH, Right in the belly.,male
BUTCH, You'd do that to me?,male
BUTCH," Did you get everything, sugar pop?",male
BUTCH, Good job.,male
BUTCH, You didn't listen to the radio?,male
BUTCH, I won alright.,male
BUTCH, Sure am.,male
BUTCH, Floyd retired too.,male
BUTCH, Not no more.,male
BUTCH," We ain't at the finish, baby.",male
BUTCH," Fabienne, I want you to be with me.",male
BUTCH, ... and ever.,male
BUTCH, Oui.,male
BUTCH, Will you kiss it?,male
BUTCH, I think I cracked a rib.,male
BUTCH," No retard, from the fight.",male
BUTCH, My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!,male
BUTCH," Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back! Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.",male
BUTCH," I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back.",male
BUTCH, Merci beaucoup.,male
BUTCH," Yes, lemon pie.",male
BUTCH," I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there.",male
BUTCH," You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico.",male
BUTCH," You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria?",male
BUTCH, Where's the shoe store?,male
BUTCH, Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time.,male
BUTCH, What are you watching?,male
BUTCH, Are you watchin' it?,male
BUTCH, Would you please?,male
BUTCH, It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.,male
BUTCH," How should I know, you were the one watchin' it.",male
BUTCH," Oh, I... don't remember. It's really rare I remember a dream.",male
BUTCH," Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember.",male
BUTCH," I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?",male
BUTCH,,male
BUTCH, One more kiss and I'll get up.,male
BUTCH, Yep.,male
BUTCH, What time is it?,male
BUTCH, Eleven.,male
BUTCH, Anything to drink with that?,male
BUTCH, Pie for breakfast?,male
BUTCH, - where's my watch?,male
BUTCH," No, it's not. It's not here.",male
BUTCH, Yes I've fuckin' looked!!,male
BUTCH, What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?,male
BUTCH, - on the little kangaroo.,male
BUTCH," Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?",male
BUTCH," Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?... I don't wanna get into it right now... but he went through a lot. Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?",male
BUTCH," You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?",male
BUTCH, Are you sure?,male
BUTCH, No! It's not your fault. You left it at the apartment.,male
BUTCH," If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader.",male
BUTCH, Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.,male
BUTCH, Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.,male
BUTCH," That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split.",male
BUTCH," Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. I love you, remember? Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast.",male
BUTCH," I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie.",male
BUTCH," Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay? Okay?",male
BUTCH," Bye-bye, sugar pop.",male
BUTCH, I'm gonna take your Honda.,male
BUTCH," Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. ""Bedside table - on the kangaroo."" I said the words: ""Don't forget my father's watch.""",male
BUTCH, Holy shit.,male
BUTCH," That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin' ya.",male
BUTCH, I guess.,male
BUTCH, Sacre bleu.,male
BUTCH, Shut up!,male
BUTCH," So you like chasing people, huh?",male
BUTCH," Well guess what, big man, you caught me -",male
BUTCH," Look mister, this ain't any of your business -",male
BUTCH, Hey hillbilly.,male
BUTCH," You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.",male
BUTCH, You okay?,male
BUTCH, What now?,male
BUTCH," I meant what now, between me and you?",male
BUTCH, So we're cool?,male

BUTCH, It's a chopper.,male
BUTCH, Zed's.,male
BUTCH," Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.",male
JODY, ... I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on body piercing.,female
JODY," Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle. Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril. One through my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud in my tongue.",female
JODY, It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.,female
JODY, It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here?,female
JODY, Who's she?,female
JODY, What's wrong with her?,female
JODY, Well get her the hell outta here!,female
JODY, Don't yell and me!,female
JODY, Whata re you looking for?,female
JODY, I never saw a medical book.,female
JODY," Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?",female
JODY," While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit. For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room -",female

JODY, Hold on.,female
JODY, Got it.,female
JODY, Anybody want a beer?,female
LANCE," Vince, you can come in now!",male
LANCE, ... two...,male
LANCE, ... three!,male
LANCE," Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. Now the first two are the same, forty-five an ounce - those are friend prices - but this one... ... this one's a little more expensive. It's fifty-five. But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went. Nothing wrong with the first two. It's real, real, real, good shit. But this one's a fuckin' madman.",male
LANCE," Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No. You're in my house. White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. My shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week.",male
LANCE," This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell.",male
LANCE," I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?",male
LANCE," No, that's Jody. That's my wife.",male
LANCE, No problem?,male
LANCE," Me casa, su casa.",male
LANCE, Still got your Malibu?,male
LANCE, What?,male
LANCE," Oh man, that's fucked up.",male
LANCE," They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.",male
LANCE, It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle.,male
LANCE, I can hear it!,male
LANCE," I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now! Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late.",male
LANCE," Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem?",male
LANCE, Maybe.,male
LANCE," Don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house!",male
LANCE, She's ODin'?,male
LANCE," Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!",male
LANCE," She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it - are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?",male
LANCE," I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up.",male
LANCE, Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone -,male
LANCE, Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house!,male
LANCE, Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenalin shot.,male
LANCE," Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book.",male
LANCE, To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenalin shot before.,male
LANCE," I never had to use it. I don't go joy- poppin' with bubble-gummers, all of myfriends can handle their highs!",male
LANCE," I am, if you'll let me.",male
LANCE," Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her.",male
LANCE, I'm looking as fast as I can!,male
LANCE, My black medical book!,male
LANCE, My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.,male
LANCE," Trust me, I have one.",male
LANCE, I don't know! Stop bothering me!,male
LANCE," While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.",male
LANCE," Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.",male
LANCE, That's it.,male
LANCE," It's ready, I'll tell you what to do.",male
LANCE," No, you're gonna give her the shot.",male
LANCE," I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot.",male
LANCE," Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.",male
LANCE," If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. Then once you do, push down on the plunger.",male
LANCE, I'm curious about that myself.,male
LANCE, She's supposed to come out of it like - - that.,male
LANCE, One...,male
LANCE," If you're okay, say something.",male
MIA," Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.",female
MIA, Vincent.,female
MIA, Vincent. I'm on the intercom.,female
MIA, It's on the wall by the two African fellas.,female
MIA, To your right.,female
MIA, ... warm. Warmer. Disco.,female
MIA, Push the button if you want to talk.,female
MIA," Go make yourself a drink., and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.",female
MIA, The bar's by the fireplace.,female
MIA, Let's go.,female
MIA, This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis man should love it.,female
MIA," You can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don't be a...",female
MIA, I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger - bloody - and a five-dollar shake.,female
MIA, Martin and Lewis.,female
MIA, Sure did.,female
MIA, Uh-huh.,female
MIA, Whaddya think?,female
MIA, What are you doing?,female
MIA, Here?,female
MIA," Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy?",female
MIA, Thanks.,female
MIA, Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.,female
MIA, That was my fifteen minutes.,female
MIA," It was show about a team of female secret agents called ""Fox Force Five.""",female
MIA," ""Fox Force Five.""Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show ""Baton Rouge,"" she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex...",female
MIA," Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist - when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.",female
MIA," Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.",female
MIA, No. It's really corny.,female
MIA, No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.,female
MIA, That's what I'm afraid of.,female
MIA," You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?",female
MIA," That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.",female
MIA, Yummy!,female
MIA, Be my guest.,female
MIA," You can use my straw, I don't have kooties.",female
MIA, Kooties I can handle.,female
MIA, Told ya.,female
MIA, Don't you hate that?,female
MIA, Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?,female
MIA," That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.",female
MIA," Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.",female
MIA, I said goddamn!,female
MIA, Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?,female
MIA," Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.",female
MIA, Pretty smart.,female
MIA, Did ya think of something to say?,female
MIA," Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know-you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.",female
MIA," You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.",female
MIA, That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.,female
MIA," Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.",female
MIA, Who's Antwan?,female
MIA, He fell out of a window.,female
MIA, Is that a fact?,female
MIA, Who told you this?,female
MIA," They talk a lot, don't they?",female
MIA," Well don't by shyVincent, what exactly did they say?",female
MIA," Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?",female
MIA, And...?,female
MIA, You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?,female
MIA, And you believed that?,female
MIA, Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four- story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?,female
MIA, A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.,female
MIA," The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once - at my wedding - then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.",female
MIA, Right here.,female
MIA, I wanna dance.,female
MIA," No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy.",female
MIA," So, dance good.",female
MIA, Missus Mia Wallace.,female
MIA, Vincent Vega.,female
MIA, I don't know what that was. Music and drinks!,female
MIA," That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but for right ahead.",female
MIA," Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.",female
MIA, Something.,female
MIA, What's yours?,female
MIA," Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.",female
MIA," If you can keep a secret, so can I.",female
MIA," You still wanna hear my ""FOX FORCE FIVE"" joke?",female
MIA," Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.",female
MIA," Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him - - and says: catch up.",female
MIA," See ya 'round, Vince.",female
MIA, Great. I never thanked you for the dinner.,female
JODY, Lance! The phone's ringing!,female
JODY, I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late!,female
JODY, What the hell was that?,female
JODY, What's he lookin' for?,female
JODY, What are you lookin' for?,female
VINCENT, Hurry up man! We're losin' her!,male
VINCENT," I dunno, some medical book.",male
VINCENT," - get your ass in here, fuck the book!",male
VINCENT, Mia!,male
VINCENT, Friend of yours?,male
VINCENT, What the fuck's goin' on here?,male
BUTCH, Uh-huh.,male
BUTCH, Que hora es?,male
BUTCH, What time is it?,male
BUTCH," Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.",male
ESMARELDA, Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?,female
ESMARELDA, Where to?,female
ESMARELDA, I have to do it.,female
ESMARELDA," Hey, mister?",female
ESMARELDA, You were in that fight? The fight on the radio - you're the fighter?,female
ESMARELDA," No c'mon, you're him, I know you're him, tell me you're him.",female
ESMARELDA, You killed the other boxing man.,female
ESMARELDA, The radio said he was dead.,female
ESMARELDA, What does it feel like?,female
ESMARELDA, Killing a man. Beating another man to death with your bare hands.,female
ESMARELDA," No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?",female
ESMARELDA, Deal!,female
ESMARELDA," The name is Spanish, but I'm Columbian.",female
ESMARELDA," It mean ""Esmarelda of the wolves.""",female
ESMARELDA, Thank you. And what is your name?,female
ESMARELDA, Butch. What does it mean?,female
ESMARELDA, I want to know what it feels like to kill a man -,female
ESMARELDA, Forty-five sixty.,female
ESMARELDA," The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans.",female
ESMARELDA," Sleep well, Butch.",female
FABIENNE, Keep the light off.,female
FABIENNE, Oui. Hard day at the office?,female
FABIENNE, Poor baby. Can we make spoons?,female
FABIENNE, I was looking at myself in the mirror.,female
FABIENNE, I wish I had a pot.,female
FABIENNE, A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.,female
FABIENNE," Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did ""Lucky Star,"" it's not the same thing.",female
FABIENNE, The difference is huge.,female
FABIENNE," No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.",female
FABIENNE, I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.,female
FABIENNE, You'd punch me in my belly?,female
FABIENNE, I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.,female
FABIENNE, Yes!,female
FABIENNE," Yes, I did.",female
FABIENNE, Did everything go as planned?,female
FABIENNE, I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?,female
FABIENNE, Are you still retiring?,female
FABIENNE, What about the man you fought?,female
FABIENNE, Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!,female
FABIENNE, So it all worked out in the finish?,female
FABIENNE," We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?",female
FABIENNE," If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?",female
FABIENNE," But they won't find us, will they?",female
FABIENNE, Do you still want me to go with you?,female
FABIENNE, I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance -,female
FABIENNE, Say it!,female
FABIENNE, Forever?,female
FABIENNE, Do you love me?,female
FABIENNE, Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?,female
FABIENNE, But you first.,female
FABIENNE," Butch my love, the adventure begins.",female
FABIENNE, Giving me oral pleasure?,female
FABIENNE, Don't call me retard.,female
FABIENNE, Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice.,female
FABIENNE," Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid.",female
FABIENNE, Butch?,female
FABIENNE, Where are we going to go?,female
FABIENNE," So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?",female
FABIENNE, But I do not speak Spanish.,female
FABIENNE, What does that mean?,female
FABIENNE, Donde esta el zapataria?,female
FABIENNE, Que hora es?,female
FABIENNE, What time is it?,female
FABIENNE, Butch.,female
FABIENNE, Forget it.,female
FABIENNE, Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?,female
FABIENNE," A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.",female
FABIENNE, In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off?,female
FABIENNE, What was it about?,female
FABIENNE," No, imbecile, what was your dream about?",female
FABIENNE, You just woke up from it.,female
FABIENNE," Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?",female
FABIENNE, You did last night.,female
FABIENNE, I don't know. I couldn't understand you.,female
FABIENNE, Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.,female
FABIENNE, Satisfied?,female
FABIENNE," Then get up, lazy bones.",female
FABIENNE, Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?,female
FABIENNE," I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.",female
FABIENNE," Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.",female
FABIENNE," Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese -",female
FABIENNE, It's there.,female
FABIENNE, Have you looked?,female
FABIENNE, Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer -,female
FABIENNE," Yes, it was on your little kangaroo. BUTCH Well it's not here!",female
FABIENNE, Well it should be!,female
FABIENNE, I believe so...,female
FABIENNE, Then I did.,female
FABIENNE, No.,female
FABIENNE, I'm sorry.,female
FABIENNE, Why does it mean that?,female
FABIENNE, Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?,female
FABIENNE," I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.",female
FABIENNE, Don't go.,female
FABIENNE, Blueberry pie.,female
FABIENNE, Okay.,female
FABIENNE, Bye.,female
FABIENNE, Okay.,female
FABIENNE, Where did you get this motorcycle?,female
FABIENNE, What happened to my Honda?,female
FABIENNE, You're hurt?,female
FABIENNE," You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.",female
FABIENNE, It was good -,female
FABIENNE," No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk - are you sure you're okay?",female
FABIENNE," Butch, whose motorcycle is this?",female
FABIENNE, Whose chopper is this?,female
FABIENNE, Who's Zed?,female
MARSELLUS, Who?,male
MARSELLUS," Well, I'll be damned.",male
MARSELLUS, Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!,male
MARSELLUS," What now? Well let me tell you what now. I'm gonna call a couple pipe-hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on your ass.",male
MARSELLUS," Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you. There is no me an' you. Not no more.",male
MARSELLUS," Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask - two things I ask: Don't tell nobody about this. This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest-of-his- short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you're gone, stay gone. You've lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?",male
MARSELLUS," Go on now, get your ass outta here.",male
MARSELLUS," Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta bit of a situation.",male
MARSELLUS," I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the ""ifs.""",male
MARSELLUS," You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly.",male
MARSELLUS, Feel better?,male
MAYNARD, Can I help you wit' somethin'?,male
MAYNARD, Now you just wait one goddamn minute -,male
MAYNARD, - I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun!,male
MAYNARD," Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.",male
MAYNARD, Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies.,male
MAYNARD, Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.,male
MAYNARD, That's Zed.,male
MAYNARD, I did.,male
MAYNARD, They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.,male
MAYNARD," Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?",male
MAYNARD, Then she'll be fine.,male
MAYNARD, I think The Gimp's sleepin'.,male
MAYNARD, Wake up!,male
MAYNARD, Down!,male
MAYNARD, Who's first?,male
MAYNARD," Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.",male
MAYNARD, Up!,male
MAYNARD, Keep an eye on this one.,male
MAYNARD," - hold it right there, godammit!",male
MAYNARD," Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!",male

FABIENNE, But what about all our bags?,female
FABIENNE, Is everything well? Are we in danger?,female
JULES," You ever read the Bible, Brett?",male
JULES," There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men...""",male
JULES," ""... blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shephered the weak through the valley of darkness. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.""",male
JULES," Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.",male
BRETT, Yes!,male
JIMMIE," Knock it off, Julie.",male
JIMMIE," I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.",male
JIMMIE," - I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, ""Dead nigger storage?""",male
JIMMIE," - answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, ""Dead nigger storage?""",male
JIMMIE, You know why you didn't see that sign?,male
JIMMIE, 'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business!,male
JIMMIE," - I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation - fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it.",male
JIMMIE," - don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house.",male
JIMMIE," Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom. ... well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do? No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't. How bad, a lot or a little?",male
JIMMIE, Yeah.,male
JIMMIE," Good, 'cause we got one.",male
JIMMIE, Please do.,male
JIMMIE, 100%.,male
JIMMIE, Uh-huh.,male
JIMMIE, She won't at that.,male
JIMMIE, Yes.,male
JIMMIE," Sure, how do you take it?",male
JIMMIE, Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.,male
JIMMIE," Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' -",male
JIMMIE," You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore -",male
JIMMIE, Sure.,male
JIMMIE, No.,male
JIMMIE, Oak's nice.,male
JIMMIE, I can't believe that's the same car.,male
JIMMIE, Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.,male
JIMMIE, I guess you just gotta know how to wear them.,male
THE WOLF, Is she the hysterical type? When she due? Give me the principals' names again? Jules...,male
THE WOLF, ... Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...,male
THE WOLF, Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.,male
THE WOLF," You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?",male
THE WOLF," I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.",male
THE WOLF, So I heard. May I come in?,male
THE WOLF," You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?",male
THE WOLF," Your wife, Bonnie... ... comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?",male
THE WOLF," I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much.",male
THE WOLF," That give use forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.",male
THE WOLF, Jimmie?,male
THE WOLF," Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?",male
THE WOLF," Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.",male
THE WOLF," About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?",male
THE WOLF, Positive? Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.,male
THE WOLF," Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen.",male
THE WOLF," Thank you, Jimmie.",male
THE WOLF," Okay first thing, you two. Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?",male
THE WOLF," Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery - now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off in. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. But the windows are a different story. Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie - lead the way, boys - get to work.",male
THE WOLF, Come again?,male
THE WOLF," Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say ""please.""I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.",male
THE WOLF," If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.",male
THE WOLF," It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin', except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon. How we comin', Jimmie?",male
THE WOLF," - Winston, Jimmie - please, Winston.",male
THE WOLF," - let me ask you a question, if you don't mind?",male
THE WOLF, Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires?,male
THE WOLF," Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do. I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?",male
THE WOLF," Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet.",male
THE WOLF," Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two.",male
THE WOLF, Strip.,male
THE WOLF, To your bare ass.,male
THE WOLF," Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-half comes pulling into the driveway.",male
THE WOLF, You know what you two look like?,male
THE WOLF," Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag.",male
THE WOLF," Don't worry, we're takin' it with us. Jim, the soap.",male
THE WOLF," Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.",male
THE WOLF," Better you than me, gentlemen.",male
THE WOLF," Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it around.",male
THE WOLF, Towel 'em.,male
THE WOLF," You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes.",male
THE WOLF," Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've planned this better. You guys look like... what do they look like, Jimmie?",male
THE WOLF," C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison. Don't make me beg.",male
THE WOLF," Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma. The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me. Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. What did I say?",male
THE WOLF, - unless what?,male
THE WOLF," Spoken like a true prodigy. How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?",male
THE WOLF," Fair enough. I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.",male
JULES, I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.,male
