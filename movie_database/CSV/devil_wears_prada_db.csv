7,ANDY, What makes you think I’m not interested in fashion?,female
8,ANDY, What’s wrong?,female

20,ANDY," Yeah, it’s just that I’m not one of them.",female

22,ANDY, I think I might.,female
23,ANDY, You are so full of it.,female
24,ANDY, Hello? Now?,female
25,ANDY, I’m almost there.,female
26,ANDY, Yes. She gave me the job.,female
27,ANDY," Actually, I’m from Cincinnati.",female
28,ANDY, What if the building’s on fire or my appendix explodes or something?,female
29,ANDY, Man the desk at all times. Got it.,female
30,ANDY, How do I prove I’m not a psycho?,female
31,ANDY, Wait. What do I do if--,female
32,ANDY," Hi, I’m Andy, I’m the new--",female
33,ANDY," That’s very nice of you, but I don’t need those. Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like.",female
34,ANDY," Actually, it’s Andy.",female
35,ANDY, What kind of--,female
36,ANDY, Demar--,female
37,ANDY, Yes?,female
38,ANDY, Demarchelier... Demarchelier...,female
39,ANDY," She called me in and asked me about Pier 59. She said something about Simone and Frankie and someone else. And she needs skirts from Calvin Klein. I think that’s the most important thing, but I couldn’t tell. Oh, and there was something about a pony.",female
40,ANDY," I tried to ask her, but--",female
41,ANDY, Me?,female
42,ANDY," So I just, what, go down to the Calvin Klein store and ask them--",female
43,ANDY, Of course not. I’m going... to his house.,female

54,ANDY, Is it always like this?,female
55,ANDY, You eat lunch?,female
56,ANDY, None of the girls here eat anything?,female
57,ANDY, I’m a 6.,female
58,ANDY," Okay. You think my clothes are hideous. I get it, okay?",female
59,ANDY," No, no, no. It’s just...",female
60,ANDY, You should have seen the look she gave me. I thought the flesh was going to melt off her face.,female
61,ANDY, I just have to stick it out for one year. Then I can do what I came to New York to do. I can’t let Miranda get to me. I won’t.,female
62,ANDY, And give me that sandwich.,female
63,ANDY," Good morning, Miranda!",female
64,ANDY, I have Isaac.,female
65,ANDY, Dad! I’ll be right down!,female

68,ANDY, Hey. Not fair. I wrote those e- mails.,female
69,ANDY, Oh please. Not this again.,female
70,ANDY, Because it’s what you wanted. This is what I want.,female
71,ANDY, I’m an executive assistant.,female
72,ANDY," You have to trust me. Being Miranda’s assistant opens a lot of doors. Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months, she’ll meet editors and writers from every important magazine.",female
73,ANDY," Absolutely, Miranda. Let me see what I can do.",female
74,ANDY," I need a jet from Miami to New York... A jet, any kind of jet... Yes, tonight, right now. From Miami to New York. As soon as possible. Please call me back as soon as the situation changes. I’m trying, Miranda. No one is flying out because of the weather.",female

77,ANDY," I’m so sorry, Miranda.",female
78,ANDY, I did everything I could think of--,female
79,ANDY," She hates me, Nigel.",female
80,ANDY, I need your help. I don’t know what to do. It’s like I’m completely beneath her contempt.,female
81,ANDY," That’s not fair. I’m lucky to be working for Miranda -- I didn’t get that at first, but I do now. I want to be here. But it just seems like no matter how hard I try, I don’t do anything right.",female
82,ANDY," Okay, fine!",female
83,ANDY, You do it with the other girls.,female
84,ANDY," Please, Nigel. Don’t make me beg...",female
85,ANDY, A... poncho?,female
86,ANDY, Miranda Priestly’s office. She’s not in. I’ll leave word.,female
87,ANDY, What do you think?,female
88,ANDY," Wanna lift, stranger?",female
89,ANDY, Bang & Olufsen. Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.,female

91,ANDY, It’s called “Pink”. For women.,female
92,ANDY, Sure you can.,female

95,ANDY, Give me the phone.,female

99,ANDY, You.,female
100,ANDY, I’ll guard it with my life.,female
101,ANDY," Hi. I, um... I have to go.",female
102,ANDY," God, I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel.",female
103,ANDY, Christian Thompson? You’re kidding. You write for every magazine I love. I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper.,female
104,ANDY," No, but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant for confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent.",female
105,ANDY," Well, I want to work somewhere like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair. I’m also a writer, but--",female
106,ANDY," Thank you. That would be great. Anyway, for now I’m Miranda Priestly’s assistant.",female
107,ANDY, Excuse me?,female
108,ANDY, I have to go.,female
109,ANDY, You. Are not a nice person.,female
110,ANDY," For your information, he’s really handsome. And we already live together!",female
111,ANDY, Where are you going?,female
112,ANDY, But I came back so we could hang out.,female
113,ANDY," Okay, look, I’m sorry about that--",female
114,ANDY," Yes, she explained every detail of her decision-making, then we brushed each other’s hair and gabbed about American Idol.",female
115,ANDY, What does that mean?,female
116,ANDY," Last time I was here, James was having this cool party and-- --and this is why you don’t like people riding up in the elevator with you.",female
117,ANDY, She pursed her lips and because of that he’s going to change his entire collection?,female
118,ANDY, --Galliano at Pastis. Done.,female
119,ANDY, It’s in the car.,female
120,ANDY," Of course. If I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right, that she doesn’t think I’m psycho. Oh, and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily. Isn’t that great?",female
121,ANDY, Shit.,female
122,ANDY, But I can’t... Shh...,female
123,ANDY," Okay, before you start freaking out, it wasn’t such a big deal. The twins said hello, I said hello back, then I went upstairs and gave the book to Miranda--",female
124,ANDY, You’re right. I made a mistake.,female
125,ANDY, Wait a second. She’s going to fire me?,female
126,ANDY," Miranda, about last night, I--",female
127,ANDY, Of course. I’ll run down to Barnes & Noble right now.,female
128,ANDY, Not that I can recall.,female
129,ANDY, So you want the... unpublished manuscript.,female
130,ANDY, She doesn’t get it. There’s no way I can get that book. I don’t care who I call.,female
131,ANDY, Of course.,female
132,ANDY, No problem.,female
133,ANDY, Or--,female
134,ANDY," It’s for Miranda Priestly... it’s very important. Yes, I know, it’s impossible to get",female
135,ANDY," Anything? Can you try again? I would really appreciate any leads at all... thanks. No pressure. If I don’t have it by 3, I’m fired.",female
136,ANDY, Yeah. It’s a real party.,female
137,ANDY, Listen. I desperately need a favor. And I don’t know many people in the book world...,female
138,ANDY," We’re talking about Miranda Priestly. There is no plan B, only plan A.",female
139,ANDY, Is she back? Am I fired?,female
140,ANDY," Harry Potter. The manuscript. It’s for Miranda Priestly. I need it today. Can you make it extra hot? Like, center of the sun hot?",female
141,ANDY," Actually, it is. A million girls would kill for it.",female
142,ANDY, Want a mocha?,female
143,ANDY, I failed. She’s going to fire me anyway. Might as well beat her to the punch.,female
144,ANDY, Call you later.,female
145,ANDY, You didn’t.,female
146,ANDY," No. That would mean I actually... did something right. But see... thing is... See, I was about to...",female
147,ANDY," Yes, I’m meeting someone...",female
148,ANDY, I’m begging you. You have to stall her. Just ten minutes.,female
149,ANDY," Actually I made two copies. And had them color-copied, re-set and bound so they wouldn’t look like manuscripts.",female
150,ANDY, Anything else I can do for you?,female
151,ANDY," Listen, Nate--",female
152,ANDY," After I called you, I realized... It doesn’t make sense to throw away all these months of hard work. I just had a moment of weakness. That’s all.",female
153,ANDY," That’s all it is, Nate. Just a job.",female
154,ANDY," I get the point, Nate.",female
155,ANDY, Gstaad. It’s a ski resort. In Switzerland.,female
156,ANDY," Nate, it’s not like I run the magazine. I just work there, remember?",female
157,ANDY, What about these? These are pretty nice.,female
158,ANDY, Are you okay?,female
159,ANDY," Great. Thanks. That’s perfect, because I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before they close...",female
160,ANDY, Um... I thought only the first assistant went to the benefit.,female
161,ANDY, Don’t look at me. This is the last thing I want to do.,female
162,ANDY, I need to learn all these people by tonight?,female
163,ANDY," Lily, just start without me. I’ll be there as soon as I can.",female
164,ANDY," I will. I promise. Believe me, this is the last thing I want to--",female
165,ANDY, And you look... so thin.,female
166,ANDY, It’s definitely working.,female
167,ANDY, That’s... great.,female
168,ANDY, I was wondering how long you think we’ll have to stay because I was hoping to--,female
169,ANDY," That’s Massimo Cortileono, chairman of-",female
170,ANDY," Ambassador Franklin. And that’s the woman he left his wife for, Rebecca. The woman he’s leaving HER for is the man walking down the stairs in Valentino.",female
171,ANDY," That’s... Jacqueline Follet, right? From French Runway.",female
172,ANDY," Alors, Jacqueline, ditez-moi, avez- vous rencontré Brad Pitt?",female
173,ANDY, Are you sure?,female
174,ANDY, Thank you. Thank you so much.,female
175,ANDY," I’m sorry to bother you, but I’ve been dying to ask you... Is it true that John Cheever used to ghostwrite the editor’s page of Manhattan Magazine in the 50’s?...",female
176,ANDY," Hey, I figured out a few things on my own, too. Turns out I’m not as nice as you thought.",female
177,ANDY, Do you really say things like that to people?,female
178,ANDY, I have to go...,female
179,ANDY," Well, maybe I could-- No no no. I can’t. I just can’t.",female
180,ANDY, Can you go any faster?,female
181,ANDY, Happy Birthday.,female
182,ANDY, Can we at least talk about it this--,female
183,ANDY," I don’t understand what’s so difficult about scheduling a preview. If you want Miranda to give you any editorial, we’ll need to see the clothing at least three weeks before the show. Yes, please. See what you can do.",female
184,ANDY, Yeah. I’m... fine.,female
185,ANDY, Great. No problem.,female
186,ANDY, Sorry. Busy day. And my personal life is going down the drain. That’s all.,female
187,ANDY," Wait. You want ME to -- oh, no. No, no. Emily would die. Her whole life is about Paris.",female
188,ANDY, But--,female
189,ANDY," Okay. Emily. When you get in, I want to talk to you about something--",female
190,ANDY, Not exactly.,female
191,ANDY, I didn’t have a choice. You know how she is.,female
192,ANDY," Look, I know you’re mad. And I don’t blame you.",female
193,ANDY, Emily--,female
194,ANDY," Okay, now you’re scaring me.",female
195,ANDY, What are you talking about? I wouldn’t miss this.,female
196,ANDY, Come on.,female
197,ANDY, Actually...,female
198,ANDY, Sorry. I’ll be too busy working. You’ll have to find someone else’s life to change.,female
199,ANDY, He’s just a guy I know from work.,female
200,ANDY, You’re making a big a deal out of--,female
201,ANDY, It just happened--,female
202,ANDY," Great. Now you’re going to give me a hard time, too?",female
203,ANDY," Miranda asked me and I couldn’t say no, okay? I didn’t have a choice.",female
204,ANDY," Okay. I get it, you’re mad because I work late all the time, because I missed your birthday party--",female
205,ANDY, You hate Runway. And Miranda. You think fashion is stupid. You’ve made that clear.,female
206,ANDY, So now I have no integrity. Great.,female
207,ANDY, That’s absurd.,female
208,ANDY, You don’t mean that.,female
209,ANDY, Then maybe this trip is coming at a good time. Maybe we should take a break.,female
210,ANDY," Hello, Miranda...",female
211,ANDY, Wait. This is not right. Miranda is staying in the suite.,female
212,ANDY, This is my room?,female
213,ANDY," Oh, do I?",female
214,ANDY," Actually, Miranda has a dinner.",female
215,ANDY," Oh, you’re so full of it. You are not desolé at all.",female
216,ANDY," Sure. No problem. I have it right here, um...",female
217,ANDY, But your table is full.,female
218,ANDY, So Stephen is not... so you don’t need me to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?,female
219,ANDY, Of course.,female
220,ANDY," Miranda, I’m so sorry. If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.",female
221,ANDY," Miranda, is there... is there anything else I can do?",female
222,ANDY, What do you mean?,female
223,ANDY," Oh, I just threw it on.",female
224,ANDY, What are we toasting?,female
225,ANDY, Nigel. I got my job months ago.,female
226,ANDY," You’re leaving? Nigel, I can’t imagine Runway without you.",female
227,ANDY," God. I’m so happy for you, Nigel. You deserve it.",female
228,ANDY, ...I’ve never seen anyone as dedicated as Miranda.,female
229,ANDY," I’m just saying, yes, there are things she does I don’t agree with, but...",female
230,ANDY," Okay, so she’s tough, but if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything but how great she is at her job.",female
231,ANDY, I resent that.,female
232,ANDY, Sexy? Really?,female
233,ANDY, I have no idea where we’re going. You could be leading me anywhere...,female
234,ANDY, You are unbelievable. Do you write that stuff down and file it away to use on girls?,female
235,ANDY," Well, I never understood why everyone was so crazy about Paris, but now...",female
236,ANDY, What the hell is this?,female
237,ANDY, Of?,female
238,ANDY, They’re replacing Miranda?,female
239,ANDY, Miranda will be devastated. Runway is her whole life. He can’t do that to her.,female
240,ANDY, And she has no idea...?,female
241,ANDY, I have to go.,female
242,ANDY," Oh, thank God. Where are you?",female
243,ANDY," I need to talk to you. Right away. It’s about Jacqueline Follet, she--",female
244,ANDY, I have to talk to you.,female
245,ANDY," Miranda, wait. I have to talk to you. You can fire me if you want to after that, but... Irv is going to make Jacqueline Follet editor-in-chief of Runway. Christian Thompson told me, he’s going to work for her. Irv’s going to tell you today. I thought if I told you now, you could fix it.",female
246,ANDY, What? No. I specifically told them--,female
247,ANDY, You said it was your dream job.,female
248,ANDY, But you don’t need her. You could just leave anyway and-,female
249,ANDY, You sure about that?,female
250,ANDY, But I don’t think I am like that.,female
251,ANDY, That’s not what I -- that was different. I didn’t have a choice.,female
252,ANDY," But what if it’s not what I want? I mean, what if I don’t want to live the way you do?",female
253,ANDY, You’re such a pain.,female
254,ANDY, True.,female
255,ANDY, I just wanted to say...,female
256,ANDY," Nate, I’m just... I’m so sorry.",female
257,ANDY, And?,female
258,ANDY," That’s great, I... congratulations.",female
259,ANDY, You think?,female
260,ANDY, Not sure.,female
261,ANDY, You think so?,female
262,ANDY, Thanks. I actually have a job interview today.,female
263,ANDY, That’s fine.,female
264,ANDY," Learned a lot. In the end, though, I kind of screwed it up.",female
265,ANDY," Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I have a favor to ask you.",female
266,ANDY," Thing is, I have all these clothes from Paris and I don't have anyplace to wear them, so I was wondering... is there any way you could take them off my hands?",female
267,ANDY," Thanks, Emily. I appreciate it.",female
555,ANDY, I came to New York to be a journalist and I sent letters to everyone and I finally got a call from Elias-Clarke and met with Sherry in Human Resources and basically it’s this or Auto Universe.,female
556,ANDY," Okay, you’re right. I don’t fit in here. I’m not glamorous or skinny and I don’t know much about fashion. But I’m smart, I learn fast and I will work very hard.",female
557,ANDY, Oh no. Mrs. Priestly’s office. That’s what I meant. Miranda Priestly’s office.,female
558,ANDY, She’s in a meeting. Can I take message? I’m sorry. Can you spell Gabbana-- Guess not.,female
559,ANDY," My name is Andy. Andrea, but people call me Andy.",female
560,ANDY," It’s just that both of those belts look the same to me. I’m still learning about this stuff, so--",female
561,ANDY," It’s not funny. She could be the most horrendous person I’ve ever met. She’s not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal. And all the Clackers just WORSHIP her... They call them Clackers. Their stilettos in the marble lobby... clack, clack, clack...",female
562,ANDY, And they all act like they’re curing cancer or something. The amount of time and energy they spend on things that DON’T MATTER!!! Poring over these minute details. And for what?,female
563,ANDY," So tomorrow they can spend an extra 300,000 dollars reshooting something that was probably fine to begin with? To sell people things they don’t need?",female
564,ANDY," God, I’m not even hungry anymore. Maybe that’s why everyone there is so skinny.",female
565,ANDY," Wow. Thank God it’s Friday, huh?",female
566,ANDY, My Dad’s coming in from Ohio this weekend. We’re having dinner tonight. Then we’re seeing “Chicago”...,female
567,ANDY, You doing anything fun this weekend?,female
568,ANDY, It’s so good to see you. You want to start grilling me now or should we wait until after dinner?,female
569,ANDY," Dad, I swear. This is my break. This is my chance. This is my--",female
570,ANDY, -boss.,female
571,ANDY, I have to get it.,female
572,ANDY," I’m so sorry, Dad. I have to deal with this.",female
573,ANDY," I’m sorry, Dad. Miranda, you don’t understand. Even if I get you a plane, they won’t let you take off tonight and--",female
574,ANDY," You’re right. I’m screwing this up. And I know this could be a big break for me. I’m going to try harder, I promise. But there’s one thing I can’t do by myself.",female
575,ANDY," Can I help you, luv?",female
576,ANDY," Hello, Miranda. Fine. No problem. I’m leaving right now. You guys didn’t need to be such assholes.",female
577,ANDY," Hi, I’m Andy. I’m picking up for Miranda Priestly.",female
578,ANDY," Great. I have to get the impossible manuscript in four hours. And Smith and Wollensky’s doesn’t open until 11:30. How am I supposed to get the steak? She’s going to fire me, isn’t she? She’s just prolonging the kill. Like an evil cat with a tiny unfashionable mouse.",female
579,ANDY," Sorry, my boss is particular. Are you sure? You’re my last shot. All right, well, thanks for trying.",female
580,ANDY, Hello?,female
581,ANDY, I’m the same person I was. I still want the same things.,female
582,ANDY," I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.",female
583,ANDY, And this skirt? Okay. What about this?,female
584,ANDY, ...it’s Nate’s birthday and we’re having a little party for him--,female
585,ANDY," Anyway, have fun tonight.",female
586,ANDY," Oh, I love that. I’ll call you the second I’m leaving.",female
587,ANDY, Will that fit me?,female
588,ANDY," Nate, I’m so sorry. I was trying to leave, but there was a lot going on and I didn’t have a choice and--",female
589,ANDY, Miranda Priestly’s office. Thanks. I gotta go pick up the Polaroids from the shoot.,female
590,ANDY," She hasn’t eaten in weeks. I can’t do that, Miranda. I can’t.",female
591,ANDY," Lily, this show is amazing. I am so proud of you.",female
592,ANDY, Nate!,female
593,ANDY, It’s. So. Beautiful.,female
594,ANDY, I can’t do this.,female
595,ANDY, Nate and I only split up a few days ago. I’ve had too much wine and my judgement is impaired. I barely know you and I’m in a strange city. I’m out of excuses.,female
596,ANDY, Shit!,female
597,ANDY," I couldn’t do what you did to Nigel, Miranda. There’s no way I could do something like that.",female
598,ANDY," Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?",female
599,ANDY, Don’t know what I’m going to do without those late night grilled cheeses.,female
686,CHRISTIAN," He’s right. I had the punch at James’s last party, woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but boxers and a cowboy hat.",male
687,CHRISTIAN, But you want to stay. You’ve never been to a party like this.,male
688,CHRISTIAN, That’s my way. Christian Thompson.,male
689,CHRISTIAN, Did you mention my good looks and killer charm?,male
690,CHRISTIAN, You and the Times. And what do you do?,male
691,CHRISTIAN, Is that right? I should read your stuff. Send it over.,male
692,CHRISTIAN," You’re kidding. Oh, that’s too bad. You’ll never survive Miranda.",male
693,CHRISTIAN," You’re smart, you’re nice, you have a point of view. You can’t do that job.",male
694,CHRISTIAN," Let me guess. You have a boyfriend waiting. From... not high school... college? Nice-looking guy, devoted, about to ask you to move in with him, but you’re not sure...",male
695,CHRISTIAN," Nice to meet you, Miranda girl.",male
696,CHRISTIAN," Of course I remember you, Miranda Girl. You shaken off the college boyfriend yet?",male
697,CHRISTIAN, The Harry Potter manuscript? You’ve gotta be kidding.,male
698,CHRISTIAN, Just tell her it can’t be done. You’ll have to come up with a plan B.,male
699,CHRISTIAN, Oh yes. A friend of a friend does the cover art. She has the manuscript.,male
700,CHRISTIAN," You want this, you better hurry. Meet me at the St. Regis.",male
701,CHRISTIAN, You have one hour.,male
702,CHRISTIAN, Look at you... you’re a vision. Thank God I saved your job.,male
703,CHRISTIAN, God I hope not.,male
704,CHRISTIAN, Evidently.,male
705,CHRISTIAN," Are you sure? My editor from Vanity Fair is in there and I was going to introduce you to him. You sent me your stuff, remember? I have to be honest, I only read a couple -- that was quite a big packet - - but they weren’t half-bad. You’re pretty talented, Andy. He should meet you. Come on in. Just one drink.",male
706,CHRISTIAN, Say hello to the boyfriend for me.,male
707,CHRISTIAN," Hey, Miranda Girl.",male
708,CHRISTIAN, It’s true. I’m profiling Gaultier for Interview and I was making plans for Paris and found myself wondering if you would be there.,male
709,CHRISTIAN, That’s great. I’m staying at a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh across the street from a falafel restaurant that will change your life.,male
710,CHRISTIAN, But that’s just it. I’m starting to wonder if I can.,male
711,CHRISTIAN," You know, I’ve been thinking, and you still owe me for Harry Potter.",male
712,CHRISTIAN, Of course you do. You working tonight?,male
713,CHRISTIAN," So you’re free. Perfect. Oh, but there’s a problem, huh? Le Boyfriend.",male
714,CHRISTIAN," Yeah, not even a little. What time should I pick you up?",male
715,CHRISTIAN, That’s fantastic. Can we stop talking about her now?,male
716,CHRISTIAN," Oh, come on, Andy. You hate her. Just admit it. She’s a notorious sadist, and not in the good way.",male
717,CHRISTIAN, I can’t believe this. You’re defending her. The wide-eyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories -- you’re crossing over to the dark side.,male
718,CHRISTIAN, You shouldn’t. It’s sexy.,male
719,CHRISTIAN, Really.,male
720,CHRISTIAN, Don’t worry. I know this city like the back of my hand. It’s my favorite place on the planet. You know what Gertrude Stein said -- “America is my country and Paris is my hometown.”,male
721,CHRISTIAN, I work free-lance. Leaves me with some time on my hands.,male
722,CHRISTIAN, Thank God.,male
723,CHRISTIAN, What does it look like? It’s a mock- up.,male
724,CHRISTIAN, Of what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline is the new editor-in- chief.,male
725,CHRISTIAN," Yes. And she’s bringing me in to run all the editorial content. Are you really surprised? Jacqueline is a lot younger than Miranda. Has a fresher take on things. Not to mention that American Runway is one of the most expensive books in the business. Jacqueline does the same thing with a lot less money. Irv is a businessman, you know.",male
726,CHRISTIAN, It’s done. Irv’s going to tell Miranda after the party for James.,male
727,CHRISTIAN, She’s a big girl. She’ll be fine.,male
728,CHRISTIAN," It’s done, Andy.",male
650,DOUG, Miranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.,male
651,DOUG, I’m actually a girl.,male
652,DOUG," Seriously, Miranda is a huge deal. I bet a million girls would kill for that job.",male
653,DOUG," Lucky for me, I have my dream job.",male
654,DOUG, -- which totally rocks. The free bagels on Thursday? The booze? The whores?,male
655,DOUG," Dammit, I love your job.",male
656,DOUG, Men can be pink. I have a pink side.,male
657,DOUG," Fashion is not about utility, Nate. An accessory is merely a piece of iconography used to express individual identity.",male
658,DOUG, That too.,male
659,DOUG, You’re going to Paris for the couture shows? That’s the coolest fashion event of the year -- who are you going to see Galliano? Lagerfeld? Nicolas Ghesquiere?,male
268,EMILY, Human Resources certainly has a bizarre sense of humor. Follow me.,female
269,EMILY, I can’t even talk about it.,female
270,EMILY," No, stay. I don’t want you walking past her. Just sit there and I’ll pray she doesn’t notice you marring the area.",female
271,EMILY," Okay, first of all, you and I answer the phones. The phone MUST be answered every single time it rings.",female
272,EMILY," Phones roll to voicemail, she gets very upset. If I’m not here, you are chained to this desk.",female
273,EMILY," I get to wear couture, go to all the shows, all the parties, meet all the designers. It’s divine.",female
274,EMILY," Okay, stay here. I’m going to the art department to give them the Book.",female
275,EMILY," The Book is a mock-up of everything in the current issue. We deliver it to Miranda’s apartment every night and she returns it in the morning with her notes. The second assistant is supposed to do it, but Miranda is very private and doesn’t like strangers going to her house. So until she decides you’re not a psycho, I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.",female
276,EMILY," Now, be prepared. The run-through is at 12:30 and people are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.",female
277,EMILY," After the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch. This is her. The new me.",female
278,EMILY, I told you.,female
279,EMILY," I get twenty minutes for lunch, you get fifteen. When I come back, you can go.",female
280,EMILY, --disaster.,female
281,EMILY," When Miranda gives someone an impossible task, it generally means one of two things. One, she thinks you can actually pull it off.",female
282,EMILY, You have to learn these too.,female
283,EMILY," John Folger. New artistic director, Circle in the Square.",female
284,EMILY," What gets me about this whole thing is, you’re the one who pretends you don’t care about this stuff. You don’t care about fashion, you just want to be a journalist, blah, blah, blah. What a load of bollocks.",female
285,EMILY," And you know what really kills me? The clothes you’re about to get. You don’t deserve them. You eat carbs, for Christ’s sake. It’s so unfair. Just go.",female
286,EMILY," Okay, so... I was Miranda’s second assistant, but her first assistant recently got promoted so now I’m the first...",female
287,EMILY, I’m trying. Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks. We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?,female
288,EMILY, You didn’t just ask me that. She’s the editor in chief of Runway. Not to mention a legend. Work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want. A million girls would kill for this job.,female
289,EMILY," Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine. An interest in fashion is crucial.",female
290,EMILY," Oh my God. No. No, no, no.",female
291,EMILY, She’s on her way -- tell everyone!,female
292,EMILY," Her driver text-messaged. Her facialist ruptured a disk. God, these people!",female
293,EMILY, Oh no. You’re still here. Go.,female
294,EMILY," I’m so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm last night, but--",female
295,EMILY, Right.,female
296,EMILY," Nobody. Human resources sent her up about the assistant job and I was pre- interviewing her for you, but--",female
297,EMILY, She wants to see you.. Go go go,female
298,EMILY, Andrea!,female
299,EMILY, Miranda decided to kill the Autumn Jacket story for September -- she’s pulling up the Sedona shoot from October. You need to go into the office right this second. Pick up her coffee order on the way. Write this down.,female
300,EMILY, Where are you?,female
301,EMILY, I hope you know this is a very difficult job for which you are totally wrong and if you mess up MY head is on the chopping block.,female
302,EMILY, One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener. Miranda missed Lagerfeld right before he boarded a 17 hour flight to Australia. She now works at TV Guide.,female
303,EMILY," Miranda Priestly’s office. She’s not available. I’ll tell her you called. Yet again. Remember, you and I have totally different jobs. You run errands, you get coffee, etcetera. I am in charge of her schedule, her expenses, her appointments. And, most importantly... I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.",female
304,EMILY, I have no idea.,female
305,EMILY, I have Miranda Priestly calling. I have Patrick.,female
306,EMILY, Did she say which skirts? Did she say what kind? Color? Shape? Fabric?,female
307,EMILY," You never ask Miranda. Anything. All right, I’ll take care of the other stuff. You go to Calvin Klein.",female
308,EMILY, I’m sorry. Do you have a prior commitment? Is there some hideous pants convention?,female
309,EMILY, You’re not going to the store.,female
310,EMILY, You are catching on quickly. We always send assistants to a designer’s home on their very first day. You’re going to his showroom. I’ll give you the address.,female
311,EMILY, Good God. You do not. Under any circumstances. Take public transportation.,female
312,EMILY, Oh my God. What took you so long? I have to pee.,female
313,EMILY, You do the coat.,female
314,EMILY, The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses every single thing in every single issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal.,female
315,EMILY, No. Sometimes it’s busy.,female
316,EMILY," Oh, no. I was quite serious.",female
317,EMILY, Yes.,female
318,EMILY," Excuse me, where do you think you--",female
319,EMILY, I have no idea why Miranda hired her.,female
320,EMILY, I knew from the moment I saw her that she was a complete and utter--,female
321,EMILY, Guard this with your life.,female
322,EMILY," Yeah. Whoopee. Okay, now, it’s very important that you do EXACTLY what I’m about to tell you.",female
323,EMILY, Do not talk to anyone. Do not look at anyone. That is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible. Do you understand?,female
324,EMILY, You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn’t you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?,female
325,EMILY," Don’t you understand? If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me. And if that happens, I will search every Blimpie’s in the tri-state area until I find you and kill you.",female
326,EMILY, I don’t know. She’s not happy.,female
327,EMILY," Oh look, you’re getting paranoid. Yay. It’s not just me. Listen, don’t freak out. There could be a silver lining here.",female
328,EMILY," Or, you know, that thing you were saying about the cat.",female
329,EMILY," You know, I rarely say this to people who aren’t me, but you need to calm down.",female
330,EMILY," Tonight’s the benefit. I’ve been looking forward to it for MONTHS. I refuse to be sick. I’m wearing Valentino. Everyone’s going to be leaving to get dressed soon, so after you drop off Miranda’s Fendi bag at the re-beaders, you can just go home.",female
331,EMILY, I don’t see why she needs both of us.,female
332,EMILY, These are all the guests. Miranda invites everyone. We have to make sure they all think she knows exactly who they are. I’ve been studying for weeks.,female
333,EMILY, Don’t be silly.,female
334,EMILY," Oh my God, Andy. You look... chic.",female
335,EMILY," Do I? It’s for Paris. I’m on a new diet. I don’t eat anything, and then, when I feel like I’m about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.",female
336,EMILY, I know. I’m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.,female
337,EMILY, Ready?,female
338,EMILY, We need to make sure we’re there the second she walks in.,female
339,EMILY, There she is.,female
340,EMILY, She knows him.,female
341,EMILY, That’s... Wait... I know who that is... It’s...,female
342,EMILY, Thanks.,female
343,EMILY, Yes. Oh my God. Miranda hates her. She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left...,female
344,EMILY, You can go. I’ve got it from here.,female
345,EMILY, Go. Have fun.,female
346,EMILY, Everything okay?,female
347,EMILY, Sorry I’m late. Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermes and she told me yesterday but I forgot and so--,female
348,EMILY," I freaked out of course, but then I just called Martine at home and she opened the store early, so I got them.",female
349,EMILY, I hope it’s not another Miranda problem--,female
350,EMILY," Good. Because I’ve got so much to deal with before I go, I swear to God I can’t even--",female
351,EMILY," I don’t care if she was going to fire you or beat you with a red hot poker, you should have said no.",female
352,EMILY," Oh, please. That’s a pathetic excuse.",female
353,EMILY," Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos.",female
354,EMILY," I said, go!",female
355,EMILY," My God, you call this a letter? Can you spell any word in the English language?",female
356,EMILY, You're joking. YOU have a favor to ask of ME?,female
357,EMILY," Well, I don't know. It is a huge imposition, but I suppose I could help you out... I'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon.",female
358,EMILY, Why can't you be more like Andy?,female
660,LILY, That would explain so much.,female
661,LILY, You have to start somewhere. Look at this dump Nate works in. Paper napkins? Hello?,female
662,LILY, Please. We’re eating.,female
663,LILY, And it’s preeeetty.,female
664,LILY, I’ll talk to her. Tell her she needs to get her own scrambled eggs.,female
665,LILY," Okay, but hurry.",female
666,LILY, I wasn’t sure you would be able to make it.,female
667,LILY, I’m just glad you’re here. Start with the murals in the other room. They’re amazing...,female
668,LILY, Yeah. That looked like work.,female
669,LILY," The Andy I know is madly in love with Nate, is always five minutes early and thinks Club Monaco is couture. For the last 16 years I’ve known everything about that Andy, but this person?",female
670,LILY, Sorry. Town car’s in the shop.,female
671,LILY, And you’d be lost without me.,female
672,LILY, Does this mean I have to give my purse back?,female
412,MIRANDA, I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to confirm an appointment.,female
413,MIRANDA, The details of your incompetence do not interest me.,female
414,MIRANDA," And tell Richard I saw the pictures of for the feature on female paramedics and they’re all so unattractive. I don’t understand. How hard is it to find a decent-looking paramedic?... Also, I need to see what Nigel has called in for Gwyneth’s second cover try...",female
415,MIRANDA, I’ll do it. The last two you sent me were total disappointments. Send her in.,female
416,MIRANDA, Who are you?,female
417,MIRANDA, What are you doing here?,female
418,MIRANDA, So you don’t read Runway?,female
419,MIRANDA," And before today, you had never heard of me?",female
420,MIRANDA, And you have no style or sense of fashion.,female
421,MIRANDA, That wasn’t a question.,female
422,MIRANDA, That’s all.,female
423,MIRANDA, Is there a reason my coffee is not here? Was I unclear in some way?,female
424,MIRANDA, Emily!,female
425,MIRANDA, It’s too dark. I can’t see any of the clothes...,female
426,MIRANDA, And what is this? I want the title of the layout to bleed over the left side of the photo...,female
427,MIRANDA," No, no, no. That’s not what I want. I made that abundantly clear...",female
428,MIRANDA, What a fantastic story. So entertaining and full of useful information.,female
429,MIRANDA, Please bore someone else with your questions. Make sure we can get Pier 59 at 8 am tomorrow... Remind Jocelyn I want to see a few of those satchels Marc is doing in the pony... And tell Simone I’ll take Frankie if Maggie is not available tomorrow... And did Demarchelier confirm?,female
430,MIRANDA, Get him on the phone.,female
431,MIRANDA, Do you have Demarchelier?,female
432,MIRANDA, No... No... No... I swear I don’t understand why it’s so difficult for you to pull together a decent run- through. You had hours to prepare... Where are all the advertisers?,female
433,MIRANDA, We need more.,female
434,MIRANDA, Is it too much like the--,female
435,MIRANDA, Where are the belts for this skirt?,female
436,MIRANDA, Is something funny?,female
437,MIRANDA," This... stuff? Okay. I understand. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and select, say, that lumpy blue sweater because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what's on your body. What you don't know is that your sweater is not blue. It's not even sky blue. It's cerulean. You also don't know that in 2002,  De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket, Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads, and in our September issue we did the definitive layout on the color. Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other major collections, then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on it.",female
438,MIRANDA, Get me Isaac.,female
439,MIRANDA, These eggs are frigid.,female
440,MIRANDA, Pick up the Polaroids from the swimwear shoot.,female
441,MIRANDA, The brakes in my car are making a weird noise. Take it in.,female
442,MIRANDA, We need the hat from the finale of the Zac Posen show.,female
443,MIRANDA, The girls need new boogieboards for spring break.,female
444,MIRANDA, Pick up my shoes from Manolo.,female
445,MIRANDA," ...and while you’re out, get Patricia.",female
446,MIRANDA, Get me Isaac!,female
447,MIRANDA, My flight is cancelled... Some absurd weather problem.,female
448,MIRANDA," Please. It’s just drizzling. Someone must be getting out. Call Donatella and get her jet. Call everyone with a jet -- Irv, Armani...",female
449,MIRANDA, Emily. Stop making excuses. GET ME HOME.,female
450,MIRANDA, The girls’ recital was wonderful. They played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved it. Except for me... because I was not there.,female
451,MIRANDA, Do you know why I hired you?,female
452,MIRANDA, That’s all.,female
453,MIRANDA," The gowns are fabulous, Ralph. We’re using the burgundy for the cover try and the lemon chiffon for the goddess story.",female
454,MIRANDA, Emily!,female
455,MIRANDA, Just let us out here.,female
456,MIRANDA, Yes. I did.,female
457,MIRANDA, Make sure you confirm my dinner with--,female
458,MIRANDA, And I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot.,female
459,MIRANDA, Fine.,female
460,MIRANDA, What did you want me to do? Walk out in the middle of a photo shoot?,female
461,MIRANDA, We were in a loft near the Seaport. My phone didn’t work. I told you.,female
462,MIRANDA, An-dre-a.,female
463,MIRANDA, I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.,female
464,MIRANDA, Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?,female
465,MIRANDA, We have all the published Harry Potter books. The girls want to know what happens next.,female
466,MIRANDA," We know everyone in publishing. Shouldn’t be a problem. You can do anything, right?",female
467,MIRANDA, My girls are leaving on the train to their Grandmother’s at 3. They’ll need the book by then.,female
468,MIRANDA, I’d like my steak in fifteen minutes.,female
469,MIRANDA, What is that doing here? I ordered it ages ago.,female
470,MIRANDA, One copy? What are my twins supposed to do with that... share?,female
471,MIRANDA, And where exactly are those fabulous copies? I don’t see them anywhere.,female
472,MIRANDA, Perfect. What about the accessories pages for April?,female
473,MIRANDA, We did that two years ago. What else?,female
474,MIRANDA, Florals. For spring. Groundbreaking.,female
475,MIRANDA, No.,female
476,MIRANDA, No.,female
477,MIRANDA, I want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list.,female
478,MIRANDA, Only when the first assistant hasn’t decided to be disgustingly ill. You’ll come and help Emily.,female
479,MIRANDA, John. Good to see you.,female
480,MIRANDA," Massimo, you made it. I was worried you’d be too busy with your new factory in Ortezzano--",female
481,MIRANDA, Emily?,female
482,MIRANDA," Ambassador, Rebecca.",female
483,MIRANDA," Ah, Bonsoir, Cherie. Ta robe est rudement chouette.",female
484,MIRANDA, Thank you for coming to our little get together tonight.,female
485,MIRANDA, And we’re all so grateful.,female
486,MIRANDA," Darling, there you are.",female
487,MIRANDA," Come on, darling, let’s get something to eat. I’m starved, aren’t you?",female
488,MIRANDA, Andrea. Come up here.,female
489,MIRANDA, Paris is the most important week of my year. I need the best team possible with me.,female
490,MIRANDA," If you don’t go, I’ll assume you’re not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication.",female
491,MIRANDA, That’s all.,female
492,MIRANDA, Don’t forget to tell Emily.,female
493,MIRANDA, There you are. We need to go over the seating chart for the luncheon.,female
494,MIRANDA," By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.",female
495,MIRANDA, Stephen won’t be coming.,female
496,MIRANDA," Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce, then “fetch” him. Fetch away.",female
497,MIRANDA," Another divorce in the papers... and we all know what they’ll say about me - - Dragon Lady, career-obsessed, drove away another “Mr. Priestly”.",female
498,MIRANDA, Don’t be ridiculous... why would you do that?,female
499,MIRANDA, Your job.,female
500,MIRANDA, Go.,female
501,MIRANDA, Excuse me?,female
502,MIRANDA, Excuse us a moment.,female
503,MIRANDA, Do not disturb me again.,female
504,MIRANDA, Are those freesias?,female
505,MIRANDA," If I see freesia anywhere, I will be very disappointed.",female
506,MIRANDA," Thank you everyone. Before I talk to you about James and everything he’s accomplished, I have news.",female
507,MIRANDA, I’m ready to go.,female
508,MIRANDA, You thought I didn’t know.,female
509,MIRANDA, Then I let Irv know Jacqueline was unavailable.,female
510,MIRANDA, Any of his other choices would find the job impossible and the magazine would surely suffer.  Especially because of the list--,female
511,MIRANDA," ...all of whom have promised to follow me whenever and if ever I leave Runway.  To any publication I choose. Of course, as soon as Irv understood, he reconsidered.",female
512,MIRANDA," I must say, I was impressed with you, how intently you tried to warn me.",female
513,MIRANDA, Of course you can. You already did. To Emily.,female
514,MIRANDA," No. You did choose. You chose to get ahead. You want this life, those choices are necessary.",female
515,MIRANDA," Don’t be silly, Andrea. This is what everyone wants. Everyone wants to be us.",female
516,MIRANDA, ...I don’t understand why it’s so challenging to get a car when I ask for one.,female
517,MIRANDA," Tell Simone I’m not approving the girl she sent in for the Brazil layout. I wanted clean, athletic, and smiling not dirty, tired and paunchy...",female
518,MIRANDA," RSVP yes to the Michael Kors party -- the car will drop me at 9:30 and wait until I leave at 9:45... Tell Natalie at Glorious Foods for the fortieth time -- no, I don’t want the tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote. I want the chopped almonds.",female
519,MIRANDA, Call my ex-husband and remind him the Parent-Teacher conferences at Dalton are tonight. Then call my husband and tell him to meet me for dinner at that place I went with Massimo...,female
520,MIRANDA, Who is that?,female
521,MIRANDA, Emily!,female
522,MIRANDA," There you are, Emily. How many times do I have to scream your name?",female
523,MIRANDA, I need ten or fifteen skirts from Calvin Klein...,female
524,MIRANDA, And Emily.,female
525,MIRANDA, What do you think?,female
526,MIRANDA, That’s all.,female
527,MIRANDA, I have to get home. Tonight. The twins have a recital at school tomorrow morning.,female
528,MIRANDA, I had hope. I always have hope. But you’re as disappointing as anyone else.,female
529,MIRANDA, Call James Holt’s office. Tell them I want to move the preview to today at 12:30. And tell everyone else. Be ready to leave in half an hour.,female
530,MIRANDA, Thank you.,female
531,MIRANDA," Oh, and you’ll be bringing The Book to my home tonight. Emily will give you the key, Andrea.",female
532,MIRANDA," Luckily, before I starved to death, Irv invited me to lunch. Get rid of that. I’ll be back at 3. Please have my Starbucks order waiting.",female
533,MIRANDA," And if you don’t have the Harry Potter book by then, don’t come back.",female
534,MIRANDA, Anyone have anything I can actually use?,female
535,MIRANDA, That no longer includes Emily.,female
536,MIRANDA, The decision is yours.,female
537,MIRANDA," Okay, so, first of all, let’s put Jay- Z at my table.",female
538,MIRANDA," When we get back to New York, we’ll need to think of a way to keep it out of the press.",female
539,MIRANDA," He knew who I was, you know. They all did. And at first they’re always proud to be with a powerful, accomplished woman. That’s what they say. But then...",female
540,MIRANDA," I don’t care what anyone says about me, of course. But it’s so unfair to the girls... another disappointment, another stepfather, gone...",female
541,MIRANDA," I mean, the point is--",female
542,MIRANDA, We really need to figure out where to put Donatella because she’s barely speaking to anyone.,female
543,MIRANDA, Have you lost your mind?,female
544,MIRANDA," Tonight is not just an important night for me, for Runway, and for James, it’s also important for someone else in this room...",female
545,MIRANDA," As of next month, James will be partnering with CFG in an expansion of his line.",female
546,MIRANDA, James and Runway have one important thing in common -- a commitment to excellence.,female
547,MIRANDA, And so it comes as no surprise that James has selected someone from the Runway family as the new copresident of JH International...,female
548,MIRANDA," My esteemed colleague, Jacqueline Follet.",female
549,MIRANDA, Let’s wish Jacqueline the best as she pursues this wonderful opportunity.,female
550,MIRANDA, And now to the business at hand. A celebration of one of my favorite designers...,female
551,MIRANDA," I’ve known what was happening for quite some time.  It took a little while to find a suitable alternative for Jacqueline, one she would accept. Turned out, that James Holt job is so absurdly overpaid--",female
552,MIRANDA," I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.",female
553,MIRANDA," People think success happens to you. It doesn’t. You choose it. Every day, I choose excellence. Who else does what I do, at my level? Nobody. They don’t even understand what it takes, the days, measured in milliseconds...",female
554,MIRANDA, But now you know --and I know -- that you have it in you. That you can see beyond what other people want and choose for yourself.,female
600,NATE, Wow. You got a job at a fashion magazine. Was it a phone interview?,male
601,NATE, And Lily works at that gallery doing-- What the hell is it that you do?,male
602,NATE, You’re a corporate research analyst.,male
603,NATE, You’re going to be answering phones and getting coffee. You need a ballgown for that?,male
604,NATE, I think you look great. Always.,male
605,NATE, Come on. Let’s go home. I can think of something you can do without clothes.,male
606,NATE, Gimme that. There’s about eight dollars worth of Jarlsberg in there.,male
607,NATE," Easy, Killer.",male
608,NATE," Oh, no way. It’s mine now.",male
609,NATE, I think we better get out of here before my girlfriend sees me with you.,male
610,NATE, All for a woman who doesn’t need anything. Perfect.,male
611,NATE," Why do women need so many bags? You get one, it holds all your junk, aren’t you done?",male
612,NATE," Why, does he need a sweater?",male

615,NATE, You got the nuclear briefcase from the undisclosed location. I’m proud of you.,male
616,NATE, Doug and some of his banker buddies are playing Texas Hold ‘Em at his apartment. Gonna go get me some of that Wall Street cash.,male

618,NATE," I’ll see you later, okay?",male
619,NATE, Quit? Are you sure?,male
620,NATE," Wow. Good for you. Congratulations, Andy. You’re free.",male
621,NATE," I went over to Dean & DeLuca -- man, they charge like five bucks a strawberry, but I figured, you quit, we should celebrate.",male
622,NATE," So you quit, but you’re still doing the twins’ science project. Big of you.",male
623,NATE, Either that or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.,male
624,NATE," No, no. It’s an important magazine. That’s what you said, right?",male
625,NATE, The new Botox. The new pea coat. The new Gstaad. What the hell is--,male
626,NATE," See? I now live with someone who knows that. Thank you, Miranda Priestly.",male
627,NATE, That’s the thing -- I liked your old clothes.,male
628,NATE, I like that.,male
629,NATE, Don’t worry about it. I’m going to bed.,male
630,NATE, You look really pretty.,male
631,NATE, You’re going to Paris?,male
632,NATE, I thought Paris was some big deal for Emily and--,male
633,NATE, What the hell is wrong with you?,male
634,NATE," I know, I know. That’s your answer for everything lately. I didn’t have a choice. Like this job was forced on you. Like you don’t make these decisions yourself...",male
635,NATE," Oh, come on. What am I, four?",male
636,NATE," Andy, I make port wine reductions all day. I’m not exactly in the Peace Corps. I wouldn’t care if you were out all night pole dancing if you did it with some integrity.",male
637,NATE, You used to say this was just a job. You made fun of the Runway girls. And now you’ve become one of them.,male
638,NATE," Look at you. Now that I know how much you’re willing to change to be successful, it makes me wonder if we ever had anything in common.",male
639,NATE, I do. I really do.,male
640,NATE," In case you’re wondering, the person whose calls you always take, that’s the relationship you’re in.",male
641,NATE, I have to be at work in ten minutes. What’s up?,male
642,NATE, Shoes. And jackets and belts and--,male
643,NATE, I flew up to Boston while you were gone. Interviewed at the Oak Room.,male
644,NATE, You’re looking at their new sous-chef. I’m moving up there in a few weeks.,male
645,NATE, They have bread in Boston. Might even have Jarlsberg. We might be able to figure something out.,male

647,NATE," I’m not worried about you. Anything you try, you’re gonna kick ass.",male
648,NATE, No. I know it.,male
649,NATE, And that’s what you’re wearing?,male
359,NIGEL, I thought she was coming in at 9.,male
360,NIGEL," All right, everyone. Man your battle stations! Did somebody eat an onion bagel?",male
361,NIGEL," We got the exclusive on the yellow Cavalli for Gwyneth, the one he showed with a huge feathered headpiece, but she’ll look like she’s working the mainstage at the Golden Nugget, so instead...",male
362,NIGEL, Who IS that sad little person? Are we doing a Before and After piece I don’t know about?,male
363,NIGEL, No...,male
364,NIGEL, Clearly my opinion means nothing. Nigel Kipling. Fashion Director. Let’s see what we’re working with. Wow. It’s like Oklahoma and New Jersey had a baby out of wedlock.,male
365,NIGEL," No, it’s not possible. Not you.",male
366,NIGEL, I guessed 8 1/2.,male
367,NIGEL, Do you?,male
368,NIGEL, She means you. Go.,male
369,NIGEL, Corn chowder. Interesting choice.,male
370,NIGEL, Not since 2 became the new 4 and 0 became the new 2.,male
371,NIGEL, Which is the new 14.,male
372,NIGEL, You’re right. That’s what this multi- million dollar industry is all about. Inner beauty.,male
373,NIGEL, Mr. Ravitz.,male
374,NIGEL, Our biggest September ever.,male
375,NIGEL," About 300,000.",male
376,NIGEL, Always.,male
377,NIGEL," I’m sorry... this is Andy Sachs, Miranda’s new assistant.",male
378,NIGEL," Chairman of Elias Clarke.  You know what they say, tiny man, huge ego. We should have taken the stairs.",male
379,NIGEL, You know me. A full ballerina skirt with a hint of saloon and I’m on board.,male
380,NIGEL," --LaCroix from July? I thought of that, but with the right accessories, it could work...",male
381,NIGEL," And that’s my problem because -- wait, no. Not my problem.",male
382,NIGEL, So quit.,male
383,NIGEL," Andy, please. Be serious. You’re not trying. You’re whining.",male
384,NIGEL," Oh, no. No way...",male
385,NIGEL, The other girls are different. They really want it.,male
386,NIGEL, I don’t know what you expect me to do. These are all sample sizes -- 2 and 4.,male
387,NIGEL, You’ll take what I give you and you’ll like it.,male
388,NIGEL, They’re not expecting us until Tuesday. Did she say why?,male
389,NIGEL, I see your point.,male
390,NIGEL, And then there’s the pursing of the lips.,male
391,NIGEL, Catastrophe.,male
392,NIGEL," You still don’t get it, do you? Her opinion is the only one that matters.",male
393,NIGEL," ...Posen’s doing some very sculptural suits, so Testino wants to shoot them at the Noguchi Garden in the Chase building.",male
394,NIGEL, Of course. A few extra yards of fabric and a staple gun and we’re in business.,male
395,NIGEL," Remember, there are two keys to wearing an evening gown -- one is to maintain a regal bearing. The second--",male
396,NIGEL," ...this benefit is the social event of the season. It represents what Runway is about -- grace, style, elegance...",male
397,NIGEL, The lizard’s better with the Dolce. Sometimes I can’t believe I talk about this crap all day.,male
398,NIGEL, Get these to Miranda right away. Tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rochas.,male
399,NIGEL, Hey. Adjust the attitude. Don’t make me feed you to one of the models.,male
400,NIGEL," Join the club. You start to do well at work, that’s what happens.",male
401,NIGEL," Hi. Listen, I need Miranda’s itinerary because--",male
402,NIGEL, That outfit.,male
403,NIGEL," Incredible. Well, I guess my work here really is done. Come on. Let’s have champagne. We’re celebrating.",male
404,NIGEL," To getting the dream job, the one a million girls wanted.",male
405,NIGEL, I’m not talking about you.,male
406,NIGEL," Can you believe it? For the first time in eighteen years, I’m going to call the shots in my own life. One day I might be able to come to Paris and actually... see Paris.",male
407,NIGEL, Bet your ass.,male
408,NIGEL," For seventy-two years, Runway has been more than a magazine, it’s been a beacon of elegance and grace. Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon, setting a standard that inspires people across the globe. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Miranda Priestly.",male
409,NIGEL," I’ve given her everything I have, Andy. She knows that.",male
410,NIGEL," When the time is right, she’ll pay me back.",male
411,NIGEL, No. But I hope for the best. I have to.,male
673,NIGEL, You do know that cellulite is one of the ingredients of corn chowder.,male
674,NIGEL, Something tells me you’ve got more polyblend where that came from.,male
675,NIGEL, Miranda wants us upstairs. Chairman’s on his way down to her office.,male
676,NIGEL, We could replace you in five minutes. With someone who really wants this job.,male
677,NIGEL," You want me to say poor you, Miranda is picking on you? She’s just doing her job. Wake up, Six. You’re working at the place that first published some of the major artists of the century -- Halston, De La Renta, Lagerfeld. And what they made is cooler than art, because you live your life in it -- I mean, not you, but some people. This is not just a magazine. It’s a shining beacon of hope for, oh, I don’t know, say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers, pretending to go to soccer practice when he was actually at sewing class and reading Runway at night under the covers with a flashlight.",male
678,NIGEL," You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls and what’s worse, you don’t care. Because this is a “stepping stone” for you. This place, that people would die to work, you deign to work. And you want to know why she doesn’t give you a kiss on the forehead and put a gold star on your homework?",male
679,NIGEL," Versace peasant skirt -- we can pull it up, belt it, make it a dress... Miu Miu boyfriend cardigan... Alberta Ferretti dress -- smocked, very forgiving. And let’s find you some Chanel. You’re in desperate need of Chanel.",male
680,NIGEL, Don’t just stand there. We have to get you to the beauty department too. And God knows how long that will take.,male
681,NIGEL, Make sure the girls face forward.,male
682,NIGEL, Not bad. How do you feel?,male
683,NIGEL, Let me know when your whole life goes up in smoke. That means it’s time for a promotion.,male
684,NIGEL, Who put that together for you?,male
685,NIGEL," James Holt. Massimo is investing in James’ company, taking it global with the rest of CFG -- shoes, bags, fragrances, the works. So James needs a partner. And that would be me. Miranda knows. She put me up for it.",male
