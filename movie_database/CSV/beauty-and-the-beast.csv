GASTON, You’re right.  Don’t take my word for it.,male

LUMIÈRE, Must have lost his way in the woods...,male
LUMIÈRE, A man of taste.,male
LUMIÈRE," Look, Cogsworth.  A beautiful girl.",male
LUMIÈRE, But what if she is the one?  The one who will break the spell?,male
LUMIÈRE," Oh, you are very strong.  That’s a great quality!",male
LUMIÈRE, I am Lumière.,male
LUMIÈRE," What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth: a man or a mantle clock?",male
LUMIÈRE," You must forgive first impressions, I hope you are not too startled.",male
LUMIÈRE," Candelabra, please.  Enormous difference.  But consider me at your service.  The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like --",male
LUMIÈRE, Uh... nothing.  Storage space.  That’s it.,male
LUMIÈRE," Or as I like to call it, the only wing!  Watch your step s’il vous plait.",male
LUMIÈRE," Welcome to your new home.  It’s modest, but comfortable...",male
LUMIÈRE, Of course.  Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.,male
LUMIÈRE," I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.",male
LUMIÈRE, How can I be strong when you make me so weak?,male
LUMIÈRE," Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle.  This is just your wardrobe.  Meet Madame De Garderobe.  A great singer.",male
LUMIÈRE," Ah, stay with us, Madame!  We have someone for you to dress!",male
LUMIÈRE, Mm.  Subtle.  Understated.  I love it!,male
LUMIÈRE," Be calm, let me do the talking.",male
LUMIÈRE, We thought you might appreciate the company.,male
LUMIÈRE," That is true.  But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. Good thinking, Cogsworth!",male
LUMIÈRE," You must try, master.  With every passing day, we become less human.",male
LUMIÈRE," Yes.  The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death.",male
LUMIÈRE," You see, there she is.  Now, master, remember.  Be gentle.",male
LUMIÈRE," And when she opens the door, give her a dashing debonair smile.  Come come -- show me the smile.",male
LUMIÈRE," Oh master, you’ve returned!",male
LUMIÈRE," Eh, I got you there!",male
LUMIÈRE, Another petal fell...,male
LUMIÈRE," I know, darling -- Ow!  I’m getting more metallic every day.",male
LUMIÈRE," They’re coming!  Final checks, everyone, tout de suite!",male
LUMIÈRE," Yes, I will make sure of it.  But did you see her stand up to him?  I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can’t fall in love if she stays in her room. Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot!",male
LUMIÈRE," A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times.",male
LUMIÈRE," Of course, of course.  But what is dinner without a little... music?",male
LUMIÈRE," Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?",male
LUMIÈRE," Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She’s counting on you to help us break this curse.",male
LUMIÈRE," Ma chere, mademoiselle.  It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.  And now, we invite you to relax.",male
LUMIÈRE," Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flambé!",male
LUMIÈRE," Come on and lift your glass You’ve won your own free pass To be our guest If you’re stressed, it’s fine dining we suggest.",male
LUMIÈRE, She’s our guest!,male
LUMIÈRE, Pudding?!,male
LUMIÈRE, Checkmate.  Again.,male
LUMIÈRE, Mademoiselle... what are you doing?,male
LUMIÈRE," Go go, Froufrou!",male
LUMIÈRE," Please, don’t go!  It’s dangerous!",male
LUMIÈRE, We are eternally grateful.,male
LUMIÈRE, Let him sleep.,male
LUMIÈRE, The master remains a beast forever.  And the rest of us become...,male
LUMIÈRE, Knickknacks.,male
LUMIÈRE," Well, who indeed?",male
LUMIÈRE," No, Master, it’s perfect!  The rose has only four petals left.  Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel.",male
LUMIÈRE, Do not be discouraged.,male
LUMIÈRE," You care for her, don’t you?  Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight...",male
LUMIÈRE," Don’t worry, master, you’ll do fine.",male
LUMIÈRE, In the dark.,male
LUMIÈRE, Dark and very very dusty.,male
LUMIÈRE," Dip dip, snip snip...",male
LUMIÈRE, And the pièce de résistance...,male
LUMIÈRE, Master... how could you do that?,male
LUMIÈRE, Then why are we not human?,male
LUMIÈRE, At least he has finally learned to love.,male
LUMIÈRE, Could it be?,male
LUMIÈRE, I know what to do.,male
LUMIÈRE, Watch your toes!,male
LUMIÈRE," We did it, Plumette.  Victory is ours.",male
LUMIÈRE," It’s all right, Cogsworth.",male
LUMIÈRE, The honor was mine.,male
LUMIÈRE," Cogsworth, we beat the clock!",male
LUMIÈRE, Plumette... mon amour...,male
LUMIÈRE," Oh, my Prince!",male
LUMIÈRE, It’s so good to see you!,male
CADENZA, Oops!,male
CADENZA, It has been so long since I’ve performed!  I can barely even remember how...,male
CADENZA," Then, I shall play through the dental pain!",male
CADENZA, Quietly?  Sotto voce?  Of course.  Are there any other tasteless demands you wish to make upon my artistry?,male
CADENZA, Will I tremble again To my dear one’s gorgeous refrain?,male
CADENZA, Move aside!,male
CADENZA," Such sweet music!  Ha ha, I’ll play you like a concerto!",male
CADENZA, Darling!  At last!,male
CADENZA, Bravissima!,male
CADENZA," Darling!  No, don’t leave me!",male
CHIP, Mom said I wasn’t supposed to move because it might be scary.  Sorry.,male
CHIP," Mama, there’s a girl in the castle!",male
CHIP, Is she pretty?  Is she nice?  What kind of tea does she like?,male
CHIP," Mama, am I ever going to be a boy again?",male
CHIP, Pleased to meet you!  Want to see me do a trick?,male
CHIP," What, mama?",male
CHIP," What is it, what’s there?",male
CHIP," Okay, I’m older!",male
CHIP," Did you hear that, mama?  Is it her!? Is she coming back?!",male

THE BEAST, YOU’RE MAKING HER DINNER!?,male
THE BEAST, YOU GAVE HER A BEDROOM!?,male
THE BEAST, That’s the most ridiculous idea I’ve ever heard!,male

THE BEAST, You will join me for dinner!  That’s not a request.,male
THE BEAST, Will you join me for dinner?,male
THE BEAST, I told you to come down to dinner.,male

THE BEAST, Should be something here you can start with...,male
THE BEAST," Oh.  Yes, I suppose it is...  Well, if you like it so much, then it’s yours.",male
THE BEAST, Not all of them.  Some are in Greek.,male
THE BEAST, Maybe.,male

THE BEAST, Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.,male
THE BEAST," Yes.  But when I enter the room, laughter dies.",male
THE BEAST, I’m sorry.  Your village sounds terrible.,male
THE BEAST, What do you say we run away?,male
THE BEAST, Another little “gift” from the Enchantress...,male
THE BEAST, It was her cruelest trick of all.  The outside world has no place for a creature like me.  But it can for you.,male
THE BEAST, Where did you take us?,male
THE BEAST," Oh, I love Paris.  What would you like to see first?  Notre Dame?  The Champs- Elysées?  No?  Too touristy?",male
THE BEAST, What happened to your mother?,male
THE BEAST, Plague.,male
THE BEAST, I am sorry I ever called your father a thief.,male
THE BEAST, I feel like a fool.  She will never love me.,male
THE BEAST, I wish you’d stop saying that!,male
THE BEAST, But how will I know?,male
THE BEAST, I haven’t danced in years.  I’d almost forgotten the feeling.,male

THE BEAST, You must go to him.  No time to waste.,male
THE BEAST, I let her go.,male
THE BEAST, I had to.,male
THE BEAST, No.  I’ve set her free.  I’m sorry I couldn’t do the same for all of you.,male
THE BEAST, I’ll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she’s still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It’s more than I can bear,male
THE BEAST, She’s not coming back.,male
THE BEAST, It doesn’t matter now.  Just let them come.,male
THE BEAST, Belle?,male
THE BEAST, Stay there!  I’m coming!,male
THE BEAST, I AM NOT A BEAST.,male
THE BEAST, You came back.,male
THE BEAST, I’m afraid it’s my turn to leave.,male

MRS. POTTS, We’ve got a lot to do -- Is it one lump or two? For you our guest!,female
MRS. POTTS, She’s our guest!,female
