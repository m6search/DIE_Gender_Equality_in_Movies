1231,DENETHOR, Where is he? Where is Gondor’s finest? Where’s my first-born?,2,male
1232,DENETHOR, They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.,2,male
1233,DENETHOR," But for Faramir, this city would still be standing. Were you not entrusted to protect it?",2,male
1234,DENETHOR," Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.",2,male
1235,DENETHOR," Do not trouble me with Faramir ... I know his uses, and they are few.",2,male
1236,DENETHOR," It has fallen into the hands of the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor.",2,male
1237,DENETHOR," It’s dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But you, you are strong... and our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He’s massing fresh armies. He will return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go. Bring me back this mighty gift.",2,male

1153,ELROND, I will not leave my daughter here to die.,2,male
1154,ELROND, She stays for you. She belongs with her people.,2,male
1155,ELROND, Arwen.,2,male
1156,ELROND, He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?,2,male
1157,ELROND," If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.",2,male
1175,ELROND, Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado...no círar. It is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now...before it is too late.,2,male

1180,ELROND," He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.",2,male
1181,ELROND," Here you will dwell, bound to your grief...",2,male
1182,ELROND," ...under the fading trees, until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.",2,male

840,ÉOWYN, So few. So few of you have returned.,2,female
841,ÉOWYN, Lord Aragorn ... where is he?,2,female
842,ÉOWYN," To mind the children, to find food and bedding with the men return. What renown is there in that?",2,female
843,ÉOWYN, Let me stand at your side.,2,female
844,ÉOWYN, You do not command the others to stay! They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. Because they love you!,2,female
845,ÉOWYN," Your son is badly wounded, my lord.",2,female
846,ÉOWYN, My lord? Uncle?,2,female
847,ÉOWYN, Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing?,2,female
848,ÉOWYN," Rick, cot and tree.",2,female
849,ÉOWYN, He was my cousin’s horse.,2,female
850,ÉOWYN," My uncle told me a strange thing. He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.",2,female
851,ÉOWYN, Seventy?,2,female
852,ÉOWYN, But you cannot be 80!,2,female
853,ÉOWYN," A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life. It was said that your race had passed into legend.",2,female

1076,FARAMIR, What news?,2,male
1077,FARAMIR, How many?,2,male
1078,FARAMIR, Who’s covering the river to the north?,2,male

1081,FARAMIR," Well if you’re not spies, then who are you?",2,male
1082,FARAMIR, Your bodyguard?,2,male
1083,FARAMIR, And where is your skulking friend?,2,male
1084,FARAMIR, You’re a friend of Boromir?,2,male

1109,FARAMIR," His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.",2,male
1110,FARAMIR," You wonder what his name is, where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there...in peace.",2,male

36,FRODO, It’s getting heavier.,2,male
37,FRODO," Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?",2,male
38,FRODO, It’s because we’ve been here before. We’re going in circles.,2,male
39,FRODO, Yes. I can smell it.,2,male
40,FRODO," This is Sting. You’ve seen it before, haven’t you ... Gollum?",2,male
41,FRODO," Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him.",2,male
42,FRODO, There’s no promise you can make that I can trust.,2,male
43,FRODO, The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.,2,male
44,FRODO, Sam!,2,male
45,FRODO, You know the way to Mordor?,2,male
46,FRODO, You’ve been there before?,2,male
47,FRODO, You will lead us to the Black Gate.,2,male
48,FRODO, Here.,2,male
49,FRODO, Don’t touch me!,2,male
50,FRODO, Gollum?,2,male
51,FRODO, Gollum!,2,male
52,FRODO, What did you say?,2,male
53,FRODO, Who are you?,2,male
54,FRODO, Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.,2,male
55,FRODO, He said your life was a sad story.,2,male
56,FRODO, You were not so very different from a Hobbit once. Were you?,2,male
57,FRODO," That was your name once, wasn’t it? A long time ago.",2,male
58,FRODO, I did.,2,male
59,FRODO," Sam, no!",2,male
60,FRODO," I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.",2,male
61,FRODO, Now!,2,male
62,FRODO, Are you saying there’s another way into Mordor?,2,male
63,FRODO," He’s led us this far, Sam.",2,male
64,FRODO, He’s been true to his word.,2,male
65,FRODO," Lead the way, Sméagol.",2,male
66,FRODO, Why do you do that?,2,male
67,FRODO, Call him names. Run him down all the time.,2,male
68,FRODO, You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.,2,male
69,FRODO, Because I have to believe he can come back.,2,male
70,FRODO, What do you know about it? Nothing!,2,male
71,FRODO, I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine! My own!,2,male
72,FRODO," We’ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.",2,male
73,FRODO, Sméagol?,2,male
74,FRODO, We are bound to an errand of secrecy.,2,male
75,FRODO," We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.",2,male
76,FRODO, There was no other.,2,male
77,FRODO, Yes... for my part.,2,male
78,FRODO, Dead? How? When?,2,male
79,FRODO," If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.",2,male
80,FRODO, Wait!,2,male
81,FRODO," Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come.",2,male
82,FRODO," I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but ... I’m sorry. The Ring’s taking me, Sam. If I put it on, he’ll find me. He’ll see.",2,male
83,FRODO, No!!,2,male
84,FRODO, The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please... let me go.,2,male
85,FRODO, Faramir! You must let me go!,2,male
86,FRODO," It’s calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.",2,male
87,FRODO, They’re here.,2,male
88,FRODO," I can’t do this, Sam.",2,male
89,FRODO," What are we holding on to, Sam?",2,male
90,FRODO, Gollum says there’s a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.,2,male
91,FRODO, I must.,2,male
92,FRODO, Thank you.,2,male
93,FRODO," Come on, keep up.",2,male
94,FRODO, What?,2,male
95,FRODO," Well, you’ve left out one of the chief characters: “Samwise the Brave.” I want to hear more about Sam.",2,male
96,FRODO, Frodo wouldn’t have got far without Sam.,2,male
97,FRODO, So was I.,2,male
98,FRODO, Sméagol!,2,male
99,FRODO, Sméagol?,2,male
134,FRODO, Gandalf!,2,male
210,FRODO, Just a dream.,2,male
211,FRODO, It’s a little bit of home.,2,male
212,FRODO, We can’t leave this here for someone to follow us down.,2,male
213,FRODO, What food have we got left?,2,male
214,FRODO, We’re not alone.,2,male
215,FRODO, Release him or I’ll cut your throat!,2,male
216,FRODO, Sméagol.,2,male
217,FRODO," I want to help him, Sam.",2,male
218,FRODO," I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.",2,male
219,FRODO, We’ve lingered here too long.,2,male
220,FRODO," Come on, Sam.",2,male
221,FRODO, Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.,2,male
222,FRODO, We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.,2,male
223,FRODO," One we lost in Moria, two were my kin, a Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two Men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.",2,male
224,FRODO, This creature is bound to me. And I to him.,2,male
225,FRODO, He is our guide. Please ... let me go down to him.,2,male
226,FRODO, Sméagol!,2,male
227,FRODO, Master is here.,2,male
228,FRODO," Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come!",2,male
229,FRODO, Come Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. That’s it. Come on.,2,male
230,FRODO, Don’t hurt him! Sméagol don’t struggle! Sméagol listen to me!,2,male
231,FRODO, They’ve come.,2,male

5,GANDALF, You shall not pass!!,2,male
6,GANDALF, ...until my task is done.,2,male
7,GANDALF, Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.,2,male
8,GANDALF," One stage of the journey is over, another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed.",2,male
9,GANDALF," Merry and Pippin are quite safe. In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.",2,male
10,GANDALF," Sauron fears you, Aragorn. He fears what you may become.",2,male
11,GANDALF," And so he’ll strike hard and fast at the world of Men. He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan. War is coming. Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall. The king’s mind is enslaved, it’s an old device of Saruman’s. His hold over King Théoden is now very strong. Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose. But for all their cunning, we have one advantage.",2,male
12,GANDALF, The Ring remains hidden.,2,male
13,GANDALF, And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.,2,male
14,GANDALF, And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit. Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo. Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.,2,male
15,GANDALF, Do not regret your decision to leave him. Frodo must finish this task alone.,2,male
16,GANDALF," Yes, very good.",2,male
17,GANDALF, Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.,2,male
18,GANDALF, I release you from the spell.,2,male
19,GANDALF," Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.",2,male
20,GANDALF, Draw him away from your women and children. You must fight.,2,male
21,GANDALF," Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defenses have to hold.",2,male
22,GANDALF," With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east.",2,male
23,GANDALF, The battle for Helm’s Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...,2,male
100,GANDALF," Fly, you fools!",2,male
101,GANDALF," I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.",2,male
102,GANDALF, Through fire and water.,2,male
103,GANDALF, Gandalf? Yes. That's what they used to call me.,2,male
104,GANDALF, I am Gandalf the White.,2,male
105,GANDALF, And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.,2,male
106,GANDALF," Yes, and it will not be easily cured.",2,male
107,GANDALF, It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.,2,male
108,GANDALF, A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days. The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.,2,male
109,GANDALF," So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.",2,male
110,GANDALF, Shadowfax. He is the lord of all horses ...and has been my friend through many dangers.,2,male
111,GANDALF," The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. Sauron will suffer no rival. From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has reached him. The heir of Númenor still lives.",2,male
112,GANDALF," Did he? Did he, indeed? Good.",2,male
113,GANDALF," Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...",2,male
114,GANDALF, Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.,2,male
115,GANDALF, You would not part an old man from his walking stick.,2,male
116,GANDALF," The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King.",2,male
117,GANDALF, Be silent.,2,male
118,GANDALF," Théoden, son of Thengel...",2,male
119,GANDALF, ...too long have you sat in the shadows.,2,male
120,GANDALF, Hearken to me!,2,male
121,GANDALF," I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.",2,male
122,GANDALF," You did not kill me, you will not kill him.",2,male
123,GANDALF, Be gone.,2,male
124,GANDALF," Breathe the free air again, my friend.",2,male
125,GANDALF, Your fingers would remember their  old strength better if they grasped your sword.,2,male
126,GANDALF, Théodred’s death was not of your making.,2,male
127,GANDALF, His was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.,2,male
128,GANDALF, This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on.,2,male
129,GANDALF, Then what is the king’s decision?,2,male
130,GANDALF, There is no way out of that ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he’s leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre.,2,male
131,GANDALF," The Grey Pilgrim. That’s what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I’ve walked this earth, and now I have no time.",2,male
132,GANDALF, Théoden king stands alone.,2,male
133,GANDALF," Sauron’s wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.",2,male
1037,GANDALF," From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.",2,male
1038,GANDALF," Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.",2,male
1039,GANDALF," Darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time.",2,male
1040,GANDALF, Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.,2,male
1041,GANDALF, But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.,2,male
1042,GANDALF, I've been sent back...,2,male
1043,GANDALF, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman’s hold over King Théoden is now very strong.,2,male
1044,GANDALF, ...somewhere in the wilderness.,2,male
1262,GANDALF, Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn ... look to the east.,2,male
694,GIMLI, Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell.,2,male
695,GIMLI, I am wasted on cross-country. We dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous over short distances.,2,male

697,GIMLI," Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.",2,male
698,GIMLI, But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them?,2,male
699,GIMLI, Dead?,2,male
700,GIMLI, It’s one of their wee belts.,2,male
701,GIMLI, We failed them.,2,male
702,GIMLI, Fangorn? What madness drove them in there?,2,male
703,GIMLI, Orc blood.,2,male
704,GIMLI, The air is so close in here.,2,male
705,GIMLI, Talking trees. What do trees have to talk about? Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.,2,male
706,GIMLI, Gandalf.,2,male
707,GIMLI, Edoras? That is no short distance!,2,male
708,GIMLI," Then we have run all this way for nothing? Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested--?",2,male
709,GIMLI," Strong?! Oh, that’s good.",2,male
710,GIMLI, This new Gandalf’s more grumpy than the old one.,2,male
711,GIMLI, You’d find more cheer in a graveyard.,2,male
712,GIMLI, I would stay still if I were you.,2,male
713,GIMLI, Helm’s Deep. They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.,2,male
714,GIMLI, Who will defend them if not their king?,2,male
715,GIMLI," It’s true you don’t see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, that they’re often mistaken for Dwarf Men.",2,male
716,GIMLI," And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women, and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground...",2,male
717,GIMLI," No, I couldn’t. I really couldn’t.",2,male
718,GIMLI, Come on. Get me up here. I’m a rider!,2,male
719,GIMLI," Forward. I mean, charge forward.",2,male
720,GIMLI, That’s it! Go on!,2,male
721,GIMLI, Bring your pretty face to my axe!,2,male
722,GIMLI, Aragorn?,2,male
723,GIMLI, My lady.,2,male
724,GIMLI, He fell.,2,male
725,GIMLI, Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way! I’m gonna kill him!,2,male
726,GIMLI, This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.,2,male
727,GIMLI, Most have seen too many winters.,2,male
728,GIMLI," Let him go, lad. Let him be.",2,male
729,GIMLI," We had time, I’d get this adjusted.",2,male
730,GIMLI, You could have picked a better spot.,2,male
731,GIMLI, Let’s hope they last the night.,2,male
732,GIMLI, What’s happening out there?,2,male
733,GIMLI, Did they hit anything?,2,male
734,GIMLI, Send them to me! Come on!,2,male
735,GIMLI, Good!,2,male
736,GIMLI, Legolas! Two already!,2,male
737,GIMLI, I’ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!,2,male
738,GIMLI, Aragorn!,2,male
739,GIMLI, What are you doing? What are you stopping for?,2,male
740,GIMLI, Come on. We can take them.,2,male
741,GIMLI, Toss me.,2,male
742,GIMLI, I cannot jump the distance. You’ll have to toss me!,2,male
743,GIMLI, The sun is rising.,2,male
744,GIMLI, Yes!,2,male
745,GIMLI, Forty-two? That’s not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.,2,male
746,GIMLI, He was already dead.,2,male
747,GIMLI, He was twitching because he’s got my axe buried in his nervous system.,2,male
1045,GIMLI," I mean, charming...quite charming forest.",2,male
1046,GIMLI, ...which is of course ridiculous.,2,male
1047,GIMLI, It’s all right. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.,2,male
1048,GIMLI, Come on!,2,male
1049,GIMLI, That one counts as mine!,2,male
1050,GIMLI, Stinking creature.,2,male
1051,GIMLI, Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.,2,male
1052,GIMLI," You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew!",2,male
1053,GIMLI, These are Uruk-Hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.,2,male
1054,GIMLI, It’s a little tight across the chest.,2,male

291,GOLLUM, Master!,2,male
292,GOLLUM, No! No! No master!,2,male
293,GOLLUM, Because Master did not ask.,2,male
294,GOLLUM, Yes. There’s a path...and some stairs... and then...a tunnel.,2,male

143,SAM," Who’s gonna to follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?",2,male

145,SAM, Mr. Frodo?,2,male
146,SAM, Let me see.,2,male
147,SAM, Those rain clouds might.,2,male
148,SAM, This looks strangely familiar.,2,male
149,SAM, What's that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?,2,male
150,SAM," Quiet, you!",2,male
151,SAM, It’s no more than you deserve!,2,male
152,SAM, I don’t believe you!,2,male
153,SAM, He’s trying to trick us! If we let him go he’ll throttle us in our sleep.,2,male
154,SAM, Hey! Come back now! Come back!,2,male
155,SAM, It’s a bog. He’s led us into a swamp.,2,male

171,SAM, No.,2,male
172,SAM," Hey, stinker, don’t go getting too far ahead!",2,male

175,SAM, Why?,2,male
176,SAM," You can’t save him, Mr. Frodo.",2,male
177,SAM," I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it! I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it.",2,male
178,SAM, Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?,2,male
179,SAM," You’ll make him sick, you will...",2,male
180,SAM, What’s to ruin? There’s hardly any meat on them.,2,male
181,SAM," Po-ta-toes. Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.",2,male
182,SAM, You’re hopeless.,2,male
183,SAM, Ready to do what?,2,male
184,SAM, Mr. Frodo. Look. It’s an oliphaunt.,2,male

192,SAM, Please. It’s such a burden. Will you not help him?,2,male
193,SAM, Frodo!,2,male
194,SAM," Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.",2,male
195,SAM, You want to know what happened to Boromir?,2,male
196,SAM, Mr. Frodo?,2,male
197,SAM, What are you doing?,2,male
198,SAM, I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be here.,2,male
199,SAM," There’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.",2,male
200,SAM," Captain Faramir...you have shown your quality, sir.",2,male
201,SAM," Mr. Frodo didn’t mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don’t you? He was trying to save you, see?",2,male
202,SAM, So there’s no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.,2,male
203,SAM," Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed, Gollum.",2,male
204,SAM, I wonder if we’ll ever be put into songs or tales.,2,male
205,SAM," I wonder if people will ever say, “Let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring.” And they’ll say “Yes, that’s one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn’t he, dad.” “Yes, my boy, the most famousest of Hobbits. And that’s saying a lot.”",2,male
206,SAM," Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn’t make fun. I was being serious.",2,male
207,SAM, “Samwise the Brave.”,2,male
208,SAM, We’re not gonna wait for you. Come on!,2,male
209,SAM," Where is he? Where’s he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?",2,male
232,SAM," It’s a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope.",2,male
233,SAM," Well, there’s nothing for it. It’s one of my knots. Won’t come free in a hurry.",2,male
234,SAM," Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost.",2,male
235,SAM, I don’t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.,2,male
236,SAM," It’s the Ring, isn’t it?",2,male
237,SAM," Oh yes, lovely. Lembas bread. And look!",2,male
238,SAM, More Lembas bread.,2,male
239,SAM," I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, it’s not bad.",2,male
240,SAM, It’s hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor’s going to hear this racket. Let’s just tie him up and leave him.,2,male
241,SAM," Get down! I said, down!",2,male
242,SAM," There! What did I tell you? He’s run off, the old villain. So much for his promises.",2,male
243,SAM, My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.,2,male
244,SAM, Look! The gate. It's opening!,2,male
245,SAM, I can see a way down.,2,male
246,SAM, ...behaving like that!,2,male
247,SAM, There’s only one way to eat a brace of coneys.,2,male
248,SAM, What we need is a few good taters.,2,male
249,SAM, Even you couldn’t say no to that.,2,male
250,SAM, Mr. Frodo?,2,male
251,SAM, Who are they?,2,male
252,SAM," You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.",2,male
253,SAM," You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!",2,male
254,SAM, Where are you going?!,2,male
255,SAM, It’s me. It’s your Sam. Don’t you know your Sam?,2,male
256,SAM, But we are.,2,male
257,SAM," It’s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy?",2,male
258,SAM, Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. They kept going because they were holding on to something.,2,male
259,SAM, The very highest.,2,male
1264,SAM, How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?,2,male
1265,SAM, Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.,2,male
1266,SAM, And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.,2,male
1267,SAM, Those were the stories that stayed with you...,2,male
1268,SAM, ...that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why.,2,male
1269,SAM," But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.",2,male
1270,SAM," But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow.",2,male

755,SARUMAN, We have only to remove those who oppose us.,2,male
756,SARUMAN, It will begin in Rohan.,2,male
757,SARUMAN, Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.,2,male
758,SARUMAN, I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!,2,male
759,SARUMAN, Burn it.,2,male
760,SARUMAN, They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.,2,male

774,SARUMAN, Take back the lands they stole from you. Burn every village!,2,male
775,SARUMAN, Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool! Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?,2,male
776,SARUMAN, You stink of horse.,2,male
777,SARUMAN, The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur’s heir. The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool. The line was broken years ago.,2,male
778,SARUMAN, Send out your Warg-riders.,2,male
779,SARUMAN," If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.",2,male

887,THÉODEN," I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse.",2,male
888,THÉODEN, I haven’t seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief.,2,male
889,THÉODEN, What is it? What do you see?,2,male
890,THÉODEN, All riders to the head of the column!,2,male
891,THÉODEN," You must lead the people to Helm’s Deep, and make haste.",2,male
892,THÉODEN, No!,2,male
893,THÉODEN, Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead.,2,male
894,THÉODEN, Our people are safe.,2,male
895,THÉODEN, Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.,2,male

904,THÉODEN, Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--?,2,male

938,THÉODEN, Come.,2,male
939,THÉODEN, We have paid for it with many lives.,2,male
940,THÉODEN, Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.,2,male
941,THÉODEN, I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.,2,male
942,THÉODEN, We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!,2,male
943,THÉODEN," They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman’s hordes will pillage and burn. We’ve seen it before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.",2,male
944,THÉODEN," If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.",2,male
945,THÉODEN," No, my Lord Aragorn...we are alone.",2,male

981,TREEBEARD, O Rowan mine I saw you shine Upon a summer’s day Upon your head How golden-red The crown you bore aloft,2,NaN
982,TREEBEARD," Bru-ra-hroom. Don’t be hasty. You might call it far, perhaps. My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe. And safe is where I’ll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one too. It’s one of my own compositions. Right.",2,NaN
983,TREEBEARD, Away with you. You should not be waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.,2,NaN
984,TREEBEARD, Bru-ra-hroom. There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.,2,NaN
985,TREEBEARD, We lost the Entwives.,2,NaN
986,TREEBEARD, Die? No. We lost them. And now we cannot find them. I don’t suppose you’ve seen Entwives in the Shire?,2,NaN
987,TREEBEARD, I don’t remember now.,2,NaN
988,TREEBEARD, There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.,2,NaN
989,TREEBEARD, There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.,2,NaN
990,TREEBEARD, The Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.,2,NaN
991,TREEBEARD, 'Tis a gathering.,2,NaN
992,TREEBEARD, Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come.,2,NaN

995,TREEBEARD, We have just agreed.,2,NaN
996,TREEBEARD, I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed ... you are not Orcs.,2,NaN
997,TREEBEARD," Now don’t be hasty, Master Meriadoc.",2,NaN

1001,TREEBEARD," You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.",2,NaN
1002,TREEBEARD, I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.,2,NaN
1003,TREEBEARD, South? But that will lead you past Isengard.,2,NaN
1004,TREEBEARD," That doesn’t make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps you’re right.",2,NaN
1005,TREEBEARD," And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully. They’re always trying to get somewhere where they...",2,NaN

1014,TREEBEARD, Go to sleep. Away with you.,2,NaN
1015,TREEBEARD," Come, the forest is waking up. It isn’t safe.",2,NaN
1016,TREEBEARD, The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.,2,NaN
1017,TREEBEARD, But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.,2,NaN
1018,TREEBEARD," But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age ... Entmoot.",2,NaN
