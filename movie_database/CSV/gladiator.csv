654,CASSIUS," You will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each -- -- which you all know is exorbitant -- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD- WHORES TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA TOMORROW!",1,male,True
655,CASSIUS," Give me your best, brothers.  They die before Caesar.",1,male,True
656,CASSIUS, This day we reach back to hallowed antiquity to bring you... THE FALL OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...! ... On the barren armies of the barbarian Hannibal!  Ferocious mercenaries and warriors of all brute nations bent on merciless conquest!  Your Emperor is pleased to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!,1,male,True
657,CASSIUS, ... in his majestic charity the Emperor has deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final match.

380,MARCUS, Now it is Rome.,1,male,True

399,MARCUS, For twenty years I have been spilling blood.  For twenty years I have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered.  Since I became Caesar I have only had four years without war.  Four years of peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can be... forgiven.,1,male,True
400,MARCUS, I have brought the sword -- nothing more!  Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here.  What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls? What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?,1,male,True
401,MARCUS," If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice. The voice I took from them.  That all the Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest.  And now that I am dying I am going to give them that voice again.",1,male,True
402,MARCUS," I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I find as I near the end I think little of the waning moments around me... instead I think much of the past... and of the future.  How will the world speak my name in years to come?  Will I be known as the philosopher?  The warrior?",1,male,True
403,MARCUS, You are the son I should have had... Although I fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood would have polluted you as it did Commodus. We're a cursed bloodline.

411,MARCUS," Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now...",1,male,True
412,MARCUS, There was a dream that was Rome.  I can only whisper of it now. Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile. The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea.  Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen.  Where every free man has a voice.  That was the dream... And I fear it will not survive the winter.,1,male,True
413,MARCUS," Let's just whisper here, you and I.",1,male,True

415,MARCUS," Look at me, son.",1,male,True
416,MARCUS," Son... I know that one grove of your vineyard is worth more to you than all the treasures of Rome.  I know one loving word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an Empire.

20,COMMODUS, There -- I warned you.,1,male,True
21,COMMODUS, Not a word about that sodomite bastard.,1,male,True
22,COMMODUS, I won't tolerate it.  His incessant criticism exhausts me.  The man can speak for five hours without taking a breath.,1,male,True
23,COMMODUS," Enough... Maximus, I would like to inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn. Please arrange it.",1,male,True
24,COMMODUS, Excuse me?,1,male,True
25,COMMODUS," Of course, how foolish of me.  Some other time...",1,male,True
26,COMMODUS, I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you... to make you proud... and I can never do it. One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years... What is it in me you hate so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My hands are your hands. All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar.  Father.,1,male,True

Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright, new age for Rome.  At my side, brothers, you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens.  At my side, brothers, you shall know the adoration of the Gods.  Doubly- dark is this day because my friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state...",1,male,True

34,COMMODUS," I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Senator Gracchus...",1,male,True
35,COMMODUS, No.  But if you interrupt me one more time I assure you that you shall.  I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past.  I will give the people what they truly want.

By those closest to him... ... by his own blood... they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired...",1,male,True
71,COMMODUS,,1,male,True
72,COMMODUS," Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I arranged it just for you.",1,male,True

619,GRACCHUS, That's not the reason.  Tell me the truth.,1,male,True
620,GRACCHUS, I knew the old man well.  And I loved him very much.  In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together.  After he went to the wars and lost his way... I was very cruel.  I tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of.,1,male,True
621,GRACCHUS, You can have no idea how much that means to me.,1,male,True
