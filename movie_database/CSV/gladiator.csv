COMMODUS, Do you think he's really dying?,male
COMMODUS, I think he's really dying this time.,male
COMMODUS, I've been so informed.,male
COMMODUS, And the Senators.  He wouldn't have summoned them if --,male
COMMODUS, The first thing I shall do is honor him with games worthy of his majesty.,male
COMMODUS, Why have we stopped?,male
COMMODUS, Where is my father?,male
COMMODUS, Is the battle won?,male
COMMODUS," My sister wants a bath, take her to the camp. Take me to my father.",male
COMMODUS, Have I missed it?,male
COMMODUS, Father.  Congratulations.  I shall sacrifice a thousand doves to honor your triumph.,male
COMMODUS," General, Rome salutes you and I embrace you as a brother.",male
COMMODUS," Your Spaniards seem invincible. May the Gods favor the Felix Regiment now and always... Here, Father, take my arm.",male
COMMODUS, She's at the camp.  She had no desire to see the gore of the battlefield.,male
COMMODUS, He's dying.,male
COMMODUS," Hail, warriors.  My congratulations.",male
COMMODUS," My old friend, my father tells me you're returning to Spain?",male
COMMODUS, A pity.  I'll need men like you in my army...,male
COMMODUS," General Maximus, may I present Senators Gaius and Falco.  Beware of this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is ""Republic, Republic, Republic...""",male
COMMODUS, You've had my ear since we were children.  You could be a valuable ally in the Senate.,male
COMMODUS, There -- I warned you.,male
COMMODUS, Not a word about that sodomite bastard.,male
COMMODUS, I won't tolerate it.  His incessant criticism exhausts me.  The man can speak for five hours without taking a breath.,male
COMMODUS," Enough... Maximus, I would like to inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn. Please arrange it.",male
COMMODUS, Excuse me?,male
COMMODUS," Of course, how foolish of me.  Some other time...",male
COMMODUS, I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you... to make you proud... and I can never do it. One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years... What is it in me you hate so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My hands are your hands. All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar.  Father.,male
COMMODUS," Lament with me, brother, our great father is dead.  I want --",male
COMMODUS, The surgeons say it was his breath that gave out.,male
COMMODUS," Even as the Gods curse this dark day with clouds, so too does the sun begin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright, new age for Rome.  At my side, brothers, you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens.  At my side, brothers, you shall know the adoration of the Gods.  Doubly- dark is this day because my friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state...",male
COMMODUS," Caesar is honored to accept your tribute, Citizen Scholar.",male
COMMODUS, Very well...,male
COMMODUS," Peace, good Gracchus, peace...",male
COMMODUS," You see that's the very problem, isn't it, my old, old friend?  My father spent all his time at study.",male
COMMODUS," I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Senator Gracchus...",male
COMMODUS, No.  But if you interrupt me one more time I assure you that you shall.  I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past.  I will give the people what they truly want. Starting this day I will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give them bread.  And they will want nothing more.,male
COMMODUS," Not just any games, Senator!  A series of games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy!  I will subsidize the arena from this day forth -- and I will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen!  A great spectacle to honor my father! Magnificent, unending weeks of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius!",male
COMMODUS, That is not your concern.,male
COMMODUS, MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL BURN!  BURN!  BURN! -- I WILL HAVE ORDER!,male
COMMODUS, All my desires are splitting my head to pieces -- there's so much I want to do -- but all my efforts to show my children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate --,male
COMMODUS, All I want is to be a good father to my people.  Why don't they understand that?,male
COMMODUS, I must take a firmer hand with them. They must know their father can be firm.  As our father was firm with us.,male
COMMODUS, Yes... yes... you always know the way.  You were always so wise in these matters... You know if I didn't have my duty to Rome I think I should be an artist. I should go away and paint pictures of the sea and leave all the politics to you...,male
COMMODUS, Still.  Always.,male
COMMODUS, And after... just sit with me. Keep me safe...,male
COMMODUS, Slave!  Who are you?,male
COMMODUS, Why is he still alive?,male
COMMODUS, He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes me.  I am terribly vexed...,male
COMMODUS," I do too.  Simple, elegant...",male
COMMODUS, I'm going to kill him.,male
COMMODUS," Oh, you're too clever, Sister. Don't tell me part of you won't weep for him.",male
COMMODUS, No?,male
COMMODUS," He wounded you deeply, didn't he? Long ago.",male
COMMODUS, I am sorry to have kept you away... I needed this time to think...,male
COMMODUS, I limited my world to these four walls so as to let my mind free... again and again my mind settles on but one question... What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father?,male
COMMODUS," They are not ""the mob,"" Lucilla, they are the people.  They are my children and all I want to do is love them.",male
COMMODUS, And what do I do but fight for them?!  I give them games to please them.  I strangle dissent to give them peace.  I empower the Praetorians to give them order. What more can I do?!,male
COMMODUS, A God is more powerful than a man...,male
COMMODUS, But I need to know -- why do they love him?,male
COMMODUS, And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too.  For a moment... they are Gods.  Offering life.,male
COMMODUS," Brother... we've taken a sad path since we were children at Capri, have we not?",male
COMMODUS, As the first act of my contrition I offer you the wooden sword of freedom.,male
COMMODUS," Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that fatal wound together.",male
COMMODUS, Will you always mistrust me?,male
COMMODUS," You think this is power?  I could show you power, slave --",male
COMMODUS, Where is my sister?,male
COMMODUS, Where?,male
COMMODUS, Where is my sister?,male
COMMODUS, Sister... join us.  I've been reading to dear Lucius.,male
COMMODUS," Yes, he's a very smart little boy. He'll make a grand Emperor one day.",male
COMMODUS," And just wait until you hear what happened to some of our other ancestors!  If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.  He was betrayed!  By those closest to him... ... by his own blood... they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired...",male
COMMODUS,,male
COMMODUS," Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I arranged it just for you.",male
COMMODUS, Oh... that's for my sister.,male
COMMODUS," Rome... This is the day that was foretold.  This is the day when your father takes away all fear... With these hands I shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in peace.  From this day forth let it be known that I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, have surmounted mortality.  That I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, assume my destined place... at the side of the Gods.",male
COMMODUS, This day I reclaim Rome for her people.,male
COMMODUS," As it was at the beginning so is it now.  The great She-Wolf of Rome will again suckle us, again ravage our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD REBORN!",male
COMMODUS, GET THE BOY!,male
COMMODUS, KILL THE BOY!,male
LUCILLA, He's been dying for ten years.,female
LUCILLA, How do you know that?,female
LUCILLA, Maybe he just misses us.,female
LUCILLA," Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.",female
LUCILLA, The first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.,female
LUCILLA, Civilization at last.  Gods preserve us.,female
LUCILLA, Father.,female
LUCILLA, You're right.,female
LUCILLA, I would have been what you taught me to be.,female
LUCILLA, Even over his son.,female
LUCILLA," Maximus, stop... Let me see your face.",female
LUCILLA, What does my father intend?,female
LUCILLA, You're lying.  I could tell when you were lying even when we were children.  You hate it.,female
LUCILLA," True.  But then you never had to. Maximus, stop... ... Is it really so terrible seeing me again?",female
LUCILLA, And you are hurt to see my father dying.,female
LUCILLA," Do you know I still remember you in my prayers...?  Oh yes, I pray... Ever since that day you saved me from drowning off Capri.  Do you remember?",female
LUCILLA," Commodus was so angry that a mere peasant -- a Spaniard no less -- touched the royal person, do you remember his anger?",female
LUCILLA," Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man who will be Emperor.",female
LUCILLA," There was a time when you didn't call me ""Highness.""",female
LUCILLA, Very different... I wonder if it was better?,female
LUCILLA," Hail, Caesar.",female
LUCILLA," Gentlemen, in the future do not concern my brother with these matters.  Come to me.",female
LUCILLA," Quiet, brother...",female
LUCILLA, Shhh.  The tonic will help...,female
LUCILLA," Our father lost his way.  His mistake was believing the old songs of the ""Republic.""  We know better. So let the Senate talk.  They have no real power.",female
LUCILLA," Still afraid of the dark, brother?",female
LUCILLA, I'll stay with you until you are asleep.,female
LUCILLA, He's asleep.  Be quick.,female
LUCILLA, Good.,female
LUCILLA, Can they be bought?,female
LUCILLA, And they've started arresting scholars now.  Anyone who dares speak out -- even satirists and chroniclers.,female
LUCILLA, The future.  The future pays for it...,female
LUCILLA, He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.  The people will be starving in two years.  I hope they are enjoying the spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them.,female
LUCILLA," And who will tell them?!  You, Marcellus?  You, Senator Gaius? Will you make a speech on the Senate floor denouncing my brother? And then see your family in the Colosseum?  What town-crier would dare?",female
LUCILLA, No -- cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.,female
LUCILLA, What about the army?,female
LUCILLA, So we do nothing?!,female
LUCILLA," It's all right, darling, you --",female
LUCILLA," Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in shortly.",female
LUCILLA, What are you going to do?,female
LUCILLA, I don't know.,female
LUCILLA, Mmm.,female
LUCILLA, What are you going to do?,female
LUCILLA, Good.,female
LUCILLA," When he defies my brother the Emperor, he defies me.  But you shouldn't send assassins.",female
LUCILLA, The people embraced him today. They will be expecting his next match... ... let him die in the arena like the slave he is.  Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar.,female
LUCILLA, Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.,female
LUCILLA," Maximus, listen to me --",female
LUCILLA, I knew nothing of that.,female
LUCILLA, I wept for them.,female
LUCILLA, Do you know what it is to be the daughter of the Emperor?  I learned on the night my father had my husband killed.  I loved my husband very much.  Very... simply.  He was a man who believed in the Republic. He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome and not conquering the world.,female
LUCILLA, So is mine.,female
LUCILLA, So do I.,female
LUCILLA," The Senate is with us, and the City Guard.  We have growing power in the streets.  But we need a leader. Someone the people can --",female
LUCILLA," No.  So that my son will be safe. So that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back. Look into my eyes, Maximus, and believe what I say to you...",female
LUCILLA, Lucius Verus.  Like his father.,female
LUCILLA, Commodus plans to kill you in your next match in the arena.  He's planning something.  I will pray for you.  As I have always done.,female
LUCILLA," Lucius, run along now.  I need to talk to the General.",female
LUCILLA, ... Maximus will summon his army from Ostia and he will strike from the inside as his army strikes from the outside.  But he insists that the Senate be present.,female
LUCILLA, How many are with us?,female
LUCILLA, I'll arrange it.,female
LUCILLA, He has withdrawn.  He's not eating. He doesn't go out.  He won't even see me... I don't know what tempests rage within him but...,female
LUCILLA, Yes.,female
LUCILLA, And they will march on Rome for you?,female
LUCILLA, Captain Marcellus will take it. And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome.  Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard?,female
LUCILLA, Caesar...,female
LUCILLA, Of course...,female
LUCILLA," Brother, do not be influenced by the mob.  They are a great, faceless beast --",female
LUCILLA, They see themselves in him.  They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his.  They think he fights for them.,female
LUCILLA, And what if he should win?,female
LUCILLA," Caesar, you let this unduly worry you.  At best he is a passing fancy -- he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral -- he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears --",female
LUCILLA, Mercy.,female
LUCILLA, Don't even say it.  I know it's dangerous -- but I had to see you. Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your message as you instructed.,female
LUCILLA, He says the City Guard will be ready at the south road at noon. They can only wait for an hour so --,female
LUCILLA, Did I?  All right then.  So everything is prepared.  The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators -- the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena --,female
LUCILLA, Tell me honestly... please... do you think it will work?,female
LUCILLA, Do you think we'll all die?,female
LUCILLA, Will you swear something to me?,female
LUCILLA, Will you swear it on the memory of your son?,female
LUCILLA, By all that you have ever loved... swear that if you survive you will take my son out of Rome.  Swear that you will go far away and never return.,female
LUCILLA, I will.,female
LUCILLA, Remember your mother.,female
COMMODUS, He has to be bled every night now.,male
COMMODUS, If he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us.,male
COMMODUS, Have I missed the battle?,male
COMMODUS, Poor old man.,male
COMMODUS, There are larger division that might appeal to you.  Even the Praetorian Guard.  You've never been to Rome. Imagine arriving as head of the Praetorians!  They have really splendid uniforms.,male
COMMODUS, Caesar retires early tonight.,male
COMMODUS, Why does Maximus deserve what I could never have? -- Why do you love his eyes over mine? -- I would butcher the whole world -- if you would only love me...,male
COMMODUS," General, the Gods' have taken the great man and left me alone.  My first desire as Emperor is that you take my hand in friendship.  I need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above all others.  Stand with me.",male
COMMODUS," Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer it once.",male
COMMODUS," Until his promised return I appointed Quintus Domitian to serve in his stead.  I salute you, Legionnaires!",male
COMMODUS," It is the most sacred duty of the Emperor to oversee the education of the young.  If I could leave no other legacy than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed.  Tutors, you hold the future of Rome in your hands. Teach them well so that they will bring honor to the Empire.  I salute you.",male
COMMODUS," Look at them, Senators... my truest gift to Rome.",male
COMMODUS, My beloved father was a careless shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a good father to my children.  I shall remain in Rome and show them how they are loved.,male
COMMODUS," He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.  All the while, the people were forgotten.",male
COMMODUS," I doubt many of the people have such splendid armor, Captain Marcellus. Or such fine mistresses, Senator Gaius.  No... only their true father knows what the people need.  I shall show them they are loved.  I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly --",male
COMMODUS, Will you stay with me?,male
COMMODUS, My dreams would terrify the world. A beat.,male
COMMODUS, SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?,male
COMMODUS, SLAVE!  WHO ARE YOU?!,male
COMMODUS," There, that's better.  Do you like the platform here?",male
COMMODUS, Father would have wanted something more ornate but he's dead now.,male
COMMODUS," Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see Father turning away from me and gazing at him.  How many times did I suffer that indignity, I wonder?",male
COMMODUS," Nonetheless, your political acumen is, as always, unerring.",male
COMMODUS, It is my responsibility to make the world as it should be.  How is it I have made this world?,male
COMMODUS," Our father loved Maximus... and I love him still... yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. And they love him for it. Just as Marcus loved him for it. Tell me why, Lucilla.",male
COMMODUS," Say I should fight him, in the arena.  Let my children see who the Gods truly favor.",male
COMMODUS, But who can be more merciful than the Emperor of Rome?,male
COMMODUS," For my own part... I am sorry it came to this.  And to you alone of all men, I acknowledge my errors. And my regret.  I shall live with my sin for all my days.",male
COMMODUS," Take it, brother.  Stand at my side as a free man worthy of your ancestors.",male
COMMODUS," Join us, sister.",male
COMMODUS, We've been reading about the great Julius and his adventures in Egypt.,male
COMMODUS," But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something dire.  He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said:  ""Tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or I shall strike down those dearest to you.",male
COMMODUS," And as a righteous God, I shall ever protect you.  I shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp it to my heart.  So I have spoken!  And let the heavens tremble at my might!",male
COMMODUS, I will make a new Rome!  Founded as it was at the beginning!  Archers -- GIVE US BLOOD!,male
COMMODUS," So it was for Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, so shall it be for us! The great She-Wolf will --",male
QUINTUS, These barbarians would rather drown in blood than yield an inch.  If I didn't hate them so much I would admire them.,male
QUINTUS," General, I don't recommend that. Our cavalry might be caught in the flames.",male
QUINTUS, Now!,male
QUINTUS, That means after three or four more babies.,male
QUINTUS, General -- Maximus --,male
QUINTUS, The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent.,male
QUINTUS, I don't know...,male
QUINTUS," Please don't fight, Maximus --",male
QUINTUS," I'm sorry, General, Caesar has spoken.",male
QUINTUS, I have no choice --,male
QUINTUS, They will greet you in the afterlife.,male
QUINTUS," Hail, Caesar!",male
QUINTUS, Don't speak of it.  Never speak of it.,male
MAXIMUS, A people should know when they are conquered.,male
MAXIMUS," I hope not, because I'm going to be leading them.",male
MAXIMUS, Hold steady... steady...,male
MAXIMUS, Caesar.,male
MAXIMUS, I don't think there's anyone left to fight.,male
MAXIMUS," Should Caesar permit, I'll go home. I've been away too long.  I've forgotten my wife's face and I barely know my son.",male
MAXIMUS," Come, Caesar...",male
MAXIMUS," For the glory of the empire, sire.",male
MAXIMUS," They honor you, Caesar.",male
MAXIMUS, Highness.,male
MAXIMUS," Caesar, you do the lady injustice.",male
MAXIMUS," If you'll excuse me, Highness.",male
MAXIMUS," What, Gallus, losing your other hand?",male
MAXIMUS, And the women of your village will crave your touch even more.,male
MAXIMUS," What's your name, son?",male
MAXIMUS, The name suits you.,male
MAXIMUS," You're dying because you love Rome, as I do.",male
MAXIMUS, Neither have I.  Rome for us lives here... ... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children.,male
MAXIMUS," Yes, it's a glorious place.",male
MAXIMUS," If you want to stay on, I support you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place.",male
MAXIMUS, I'll return after a season at home. Maybe two.,male
MAXIMUS, Should the Gods so bless me.  I would be thankful.,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS, I'm going home.,male
MAXIMUS, No.,male
MAXIMUS," I'm a soldier, not a politician.",male
MAXIMUS, I can't do that.,male
MAXIMUS, My men have been fighting for five solid days.  They're too busy dying to go on dress parade.,male
MAXIMUS, Caesar.,male
MAXIMUS," I never acquired the art, sir.",male
MAXIMUS," Caesar, I am honored but --",male
MAXIMUS," Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness.  You brought civilization and justice to the farthest --",male
MAXIMUS," Yes, Caesar.",male
MAXIMUS, You're not dying.,male
MAXIMUS," Caesar, you do me honor -- but your son has pride of place for succession.",male
MAXIMUS," I shall, Caesar.",male
MAXIMUS, You have always been my father.,male
MAXIMUS, That's not true.,male
MAXIMUS, I lost too many men.,male
MAXIMUS, I don't know.,male
MAXIMUS, I never acquired your comfort with it.,male
MAXIMUS, No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the battle.,male
MAXIMUS, I will always serve the ideals of Rome.,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS," May I be permitted to go, Highness?",male
MAXIMUS, And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea.  All that was a different life.,male
MAXIMUS, It was more honest.,male
MAXIMUS," Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance.  Bring me your solace and your wisdom. Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword.  Keep them safe until my return.  Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air. Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.",male
MAXIMUS, Quintus -- ?,male
MAXIMUS, What is it?  Is he ill?,male
MAXIMUS, How did he die?,male
MAXIMUS," How will the world speak your name now, old man?",male
MAXIMUS, What -- ?!,male
MAXIMUS, Quintus --,male
MAXIMUS," Quintus, what -- ?",male
MAXIMUS, My family?!,male
MAXIMUS, Have you ever done this before?,male
MAXIMUS, Killed a man with a sword?,male
MAXIMUS, It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor.  You don't want to hack me up now.  You want one clean stroke.,male
MAXIMUS," One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you?",male
MAXIMUS, If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere.  Quite a spray.,male
MAXIMUS, Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck --,male
MAXIMUS, Am I in Hades?,male
MAXIMUS, Gladiator.,male
MAXIMUS, Nothing more.,male
MAXIMUS, The Emperor -- will he be there?,male
MAXIMUS, Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor?,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS, He gives it personally?,male
MAXIMUS, You knew Marcus?,male
MAXIMUS, No.,male
MAXIMUS, Bigger arena.  Same killing.,male
MAXIMUS, No.,male
MAXIMUS, This isn't my home.,male
MAXIMUS, Perhaps one day you'll return.,male
MAXIMUS," Yes, but --",male
MAXIMUS, What -- ?,male
MAXIMUS," I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS!",male
MAXIMUS, This isn't your battle.,male
MAXIMUS, I knew your brother would send assassins.  I didn't think he would send his best.,male
MAXIMUS, My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive.,male
MAXIMUS, Don't lie to me.,male
MAXIMUS, Don't.,male
MAXIMUS, My son was innocent.,male
MAXIMUS, I want your brother dead.,male
MAXIMUS, How do you plan it?,male
MAXIMUS, So the crown passes to your son.,male
MAXIMUS, What is your son's name?,male
MAXIMUS, I weep for him.,male
MAXIMUS, What can you tell me?,male
MAXIMUS, I was a General.,male
MAXIMUS, It doesn't take courage to kill.,male
MAXIMUS, I'm sorry.,male
MAXIMUS, I had a father.  He wasn't really my father but I cared for him very much.,male
MAXIMUS, Where is my army?,male
MAXIMUS, I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it.,male
MAXIMUS, Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival.,male
MAXIMUS," Yes.  But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else.",male
MAXIMUS, The Felix Regiment will never be defeated.,male
MAXIMUS, I want Commodus dead.,male
MAXIMUS, Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream.  I will die for that dream.,male
MAXIMUS, He did.,male
MAXIMUS," As will I, Commodus.  As will I.",male
MAXIMUS," I only have ancestors because of you, brother.  You killed everything that ever lived alongside me.",male
MAXIMUS, This is the new home you cursed me to.  And I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside.,male
MAXIMUS, Why don't you ask your father that?,male
MAXIMUS," No, Caesar... I will show you.",male
MAXIMUS, The Felix Regiment will come from here.  We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here.,male
MAXIMUS, Probably.,male
MAXIMUS, Then be worthy of him.  The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat.,male
MAXIMUS, Was it Centurion...?  General...?,male
MAXIMUS, A soldier knows a soldier.,male
MAXIMUS, No --,male
MAXIMUS," You said something to me once.  You said in this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Do you recall those words?",male
MAXIMUS," Then be remembered proudly.  This is your time, Proximo.  Stand at my side and be what you were.  What you truly are.  One last time.",male
MAXIMUS, You pox-ridden bastard -- !,male
MAXIMUS, A quarter?!,male
MAXIMUS," You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man.",male
MAXIMUS, Lucilla --,male
MAXIMUS, Good.,male
MAXIMUS, You've told me this already.,male
MAXIMUS, Lucilla... why are you here?,male
MAXIMUS, No.,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS, Yes.,male
MAXIMUS, I will.,male
MAXIMUS, Shhh... my heart breaks enough.,male
MAXIMUS, But --,male
MAXIMUS, We were betrayed.,male
MAXIMUS, You're not coming?,male
MAXIMUS, Old friend...,male
MAXIMUS, Where is he?,male
MAXIMUS, Throw down your weapons or we will kill you.,male
MAXIMUS, Captain?,male
MAXIMUS, For my wife!,male
MAXIMUS, Rome... you are better than this. Look inside yourselves.  I challenge you to find your true voice.,male
MAXIMUS," It doesn't look it now... but soon we'll have it growing again... Next year there will be vines, and then there will be grapes... It will be alive.",male
MAXIMUS, At the first signal release the catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat.,male
MAXIMUS, Why don't they know they're already dead?,male
MAXIMUS, Steady...,male
MAXIMUS, Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!,male
MAXIMUS, I thank you for your prayers.,male
MAXIMUS, How did he die?,male
MAXIMUS," What about my family, Quintus?",male
MAXIMUS," Put the point of your sword here... you want one, good blow right at this spot --",male
MAXIMUS, I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!,male
MAXIMUS, I have more power as a slave in the arena than I could ever have as a free man.,male
MAXIMUS, -- a covert assault from within.,male
MAXIMUS," But if we aren't... think of the glory.  Do you remember glory, Gladiator?",male
MAXIMUS, And if I should not survive... swear to me that you will honor my family in your prayers always.,male
MAXIMUS, I forgive you.,male
MAXIMUS, FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU!,male
MAXIMUS, Where are they going?!,male
MAXIMUS, For my son!,male
MAXIMUS, For my father!,male
MAXIMUS, We who are about to die salute you.,male
MAXIMUS, I give you back the dream.,male
MAXIMUS," When everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take them home.",male
MARCUS," Maximus, you prove your valor again. Let us hope for the final time here.",male
MARCUS, There are always people left to fight...,male
MARCUS, Stop... ... You speak our language?,male
MARCUS," No.  Let him speak... ... I am Rome, what would you say to me?",male
MARCUS, Now it is Rome.,male
MARCUS, No... Release him.  Give him safe passage.  Let him go to his family.,male
MARCUS, Yes.  I remember.,male
MARCUS," I don't think they're standing for me, Maximus.  They honor you.",male
MARCUS, You've missed the war.  We're done here.,male
MARCUS," Spare the doves and honor Maximus, he won the battle.",male
MARCUS, Where's your sister?,male
MARCUS, Lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne.,male
MARCUS, It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't recognize his own off- spring... I think... I should ride now.,male
MARCUS," Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you.",male
MARCUS, All the while conspiring with that fat man in Rome.  How is the old monster?,male
MARCUS, Still damning me to the four winds?,male
MARCUS, I would have silenced him decades ago -- but I just like him too much.,male
MARCUS, If only you had been born a man...,male
MARCUS, What a Caesar you would have made.,male
MARCUS, I think you would have been strong. I wonder if you would have been just?,male
MARCUS," Well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber.",male
MARCUS, Read this.,male
MARCUS, Of course.  No matter.  In this letter I denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after my death.,male
MARCUS, For twenty years I have been spilling blood.  For twenty years I have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered.  Since I became Caesar I have only had four years without war.  Four years of peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can be... forgiven.,male
MARCUS, I have brought the sword -- nothing more!  Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here.  What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls? What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?,male
MARCUS," If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice. The voice I took from them.  That all the Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest.  And now that I am dying I am going to give them that voice again.",male
MARCUS," I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I find as I near the end I think little of the waning moments around me... instead I think much of the past... and of the future.  How will the world speak my name in years to come?  Will I be known as the philosopher?  The warrior?",male
MARCUS, You are the son I should have had... Although I fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood would have polluted you as it did Commodus. We're a cursed bloodline.  We have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a life without it. We can no longer even imagine a life without it.,male
MARCUS, I'll keep this letter to myself.  I hope that with the sunrise you will agree.  And embrace me as a father.,male
MARCUS," But this night, at least, Germania is at last defeated... What will you do now, my friend?",male
MARCUS," Tell me again, Maximus, why are we here?",male
MARCUS, So much for the glory of Rome.,male
MARCUS," This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?",male
MARCUS, My son is not a moral man.  You have known this since you were young.  He cannot rule.,male
MARCUS," While I have been fighting, Rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased.  I did this.  And now I shall make it right.",male
MARCUS," Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now...",male
MARCUS, There was a dream that was Rome.  I can only whisper of it now. Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile. The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea.  Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen.  Where every free man has a voice.  That was the dream... And I fear it will not survive the winter.,male
MARCUS," Let's just whisper here, you and I.",male
MARCUS," Before I die I will give the people this final gift.  I will give them the Senate reborn.  The voice of the people empowered again, as it was always meant to be.  It is my design that they will elect the next Emperor.  And I would put forward your name with my backing.",male
MARCUS," Look at me, son.",male
MARCUS," Son... I know that one grove of your vineyard is worth more to you than all the treasures of Rome.  I know one loving word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an Empire.  But... a fond old man, who loves you more than he can say, begs you to at least think about what he has said tonight.",male
GAIUS, We live in supplication to your glory.,male
GAIUS," Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.",male
GAIUS," Still eager for your triumphant return to Rome, Caesar.",male
GAIUS, ... And why not apply for entry to the Senate?,male
GAIUS, Are you a believer in Republicanism?,male
GAIUS," If your heart lies with the people, I would back you for the Senate. I'm sure Gracchus would as well.",male
GAIUS, The august Senator Gracchus has been rather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family.,male
GAIUS, He lives under the antiquated assumption that the Senate should represent the people with vigor.,male
GAIUS, He serves Rome best when he serves it with honesty.,male
GAIUS, Do you think he'll listen to us?,male
GAIUS, It's madness.,male
GAIUS, And what pays for it?  These games are costing a fortune and yet we have no new taxes.,male
GAIUS, No.,male
GAIUS, The Praetorians would only seize control themselves.,male
GAIUS, No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years.,male
GAIUS, We've been ordered to attend.,male
GAIUS, And what of the Emperor?,male
GAIUS, One question... who is to be the actual Regicide?,male
LUCILLA, You've been crying.,female
LUCILLA, He will announce Commodus' succession.  That's why he summoned us.  Will you serve my brother as you served his father?,female
LUCILLA, Leave the Senate to me.  Don't trouble yourself.,female
LUCILLA," Yes, just drink this down.",female
LUCILLA, He's started selling the grain reserves.,female
LUCILLA, He must die.,female
LUCILLA, My son will live.  He will survive this cursed bloodline.  Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive. Empires come and go.  Cities crumble to dust.  Only family matters.,female
LUCILLA, My son will never be safe while he lives.,female
LUCILLA," By all the Gods, and in the name of my father who loved you, and in the name of the husband I loved... I swear to stand by your side in this now and always.",female
LUCILLA, He will not kill in the arena.  He is merciful.  As they all wish they were in their own hearts.,female
LUCILLA, Had I not been the daughter of Rome...,female
QUINTUS, Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him.,male
JUBA, Yes.,male
JUBA, Have you killed a man before? Maximus does not respond.,male
JUBA, Are we going to fight each other?,male
JUBA, Do you think it will be much different?  Here in Rome?,male
JUBA, Are you scared for tomorrow?,male
JUBA, Me too.,male
JUBA, For all Romans... this is home.,male
JUBA," How can I go back?  I am not what I was.  When a man kills for no reason, he has lost himself.",male
JUBA, I will fight with you.,male
JUBA, Better to die for a friend than to die for gold.,male
JUBA, And if we die that day -- we die free men worthy of our ancestors.,male
JUBA, And impotent.,male
JUBA, How did they know?,male
JUBA, I'll stay here.  In case they follow.,male
JUBA, For your wound... Maximus stares at him.,male
JUBA, For your wound.,male
JUBA, If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions... The lions are worth more than we are.  I think we are worth more than the zebras though.  So they don't feed us to them.,male
JUBA, I'm not sure about the giraffe.,male
JUBA, You should eat.  You'll need your strength tomorrow.,male
JUBA, I've never killed a man.  But I think you have.,male
JUBA, I almost killed once.  The Romans destroyed my village.  I was with a hunting party and when we returned... I would have killed every Roman in the world.,male
JUBA, If you don't eat you will die.,male
JUBA," In the village I come from there was a man once.  He went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles.  One of them ate his leg.  He pulled himself to the shore and a lion attacked him.  It ate one of his arms.  He dragged himself through the desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he only had one eye.  When he reached the village I sat with him.  I said, ""You have lost a leg, an arm and one eye.  You must have a mighty will to live.""  He said, ""No, Lord, it's just better than the alternative.""",male
JUBA, Life is a gift from our fathers to us.  Who are you to give it up for lack of lifting a spoon?,male
JUBA, I never though it would be so easy to kill.,male
JUBA, So you're finally home.,male
JUBA," Among my people we honor the soil of our home.  Our ancestors are in that soil.  All their dreams live there. I will never see my home again.  The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die.",male
JUBA, Go!  Bring us the army!,male
PROXIMO, Those giraffes you sold me won't mate!,male
PROXIMO, How much for the lot?,male
PROXIMO," For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want to see their balls first.  And you throw in those two slaves.",male
PROXIMO, Good teeth --,male
PROXIMO," My ass... You throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot.",male
PROXIMO," All right, let's see.",male
PROXIMO, I'll give you 500 sesterces.,male
PROXIMO," Come, don't quibble with your old friend.  I'll take the lions, the panther, the Numidian and this one for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the best whore in the town for two nights.  She's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand.",male
PROXIMO," COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!",male
PROXIMO," Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't be bothering you for long.",male
PROXIMO," Some of you say you can't fight, you won't fight... They all say that... But one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man.  And the crowd will cheer you and love you.  And you will love them for it. On that day... you will be a gladiator.",male
PROXIMO, Make it 600 sesterces for each decapitation.,male
PROXIMO, Two.,male
PROXIMO, Done. strokes.,male
PROXIMO, A Greek Scribe.,male
PROXIMO," Give me odds, friend.",male
PROXIMO, I've wagered on you against the Celts -- ignore the others and go for them -- there are two axe-and- net and two long spear.  Now the Celts aren't used to the sun so you have the advantage there...,male
PROXIMO, Butterfly?,male
PROXIMO, And nothing more?,male
PROXIMO, In two days we leave for Rome.,male
PROXIMO," Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad about the games.  Spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again.  But what is good for you, Gladiator?",male
PROXIMO, As a gladiator?,male
PROXIMO, One doesn't.,male
PROXIMO, He did to me... Our great father Marcus Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder.,male
PROXIMO, I didn't know him.  He touched me on the shoulder.  Just once.  But that was enough.,male
PROXIMO, Stop that!  You'll get some monstrous disease and then you'll be worth nothing to me!,male
PROXIMO," No -- have pity, Cassius -- !",male
PROXIMO," I won't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces -- !",male
PROXIMO, I won't throw my Spaniard into a spectacle!  Damn you and damn the rotation!,male
PROXIMO," I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians.",male
PROXIMO," Then make the wager, you smug bastard!",male
PROXIMO," All right -- there are three other teams, four men each -- You know what a Thracian looks like?",male
PROXIMO, Ignore the others -- go for the Thracians.  The sun is to the east - - over the gate -- keep your back to the gate and you won't have the sun.,male
PROXIMO, Hurry -- !,male
PROXIMO," Enjoy yourself, Madame...",male
PROXIMO, Gods!  That old Homicide!  The Emperor must truly hate you.,male
PROXIMO, He cheats.,male
PROXIMO, Captain.,male
PROXIMO, All that was a long time ago.  Too much wine and too many women.  And too much money.,male
PROXIMO, This is who I am... You see?,male
PROXIMO, Yes.,male
PROXIMO," You might have spared yourself the speech, General.  The lady Lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago!",male
PROXIMO, I am the richest trainer in the Empire!,male
PROXIMO, A third.  And not a hair more.  And you'll have to start in the provinces!  Cleaning up the lion shit!,male
PROXIMO, Release them!  Release them all! ARM THEM!,male
PROXIMO, If you want to live -- follow me --,male
PROXIMO, All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed --,male
PROXIMO, Quickly --,male
PROXIMO, Down that corridor is the butchery - - the blood sloughs lead to the Tiber.  Gods watch over you.,male
PROXIMO, They are killing my men!,male
PROXIMO, Gods... they're killing them all.,male
PROXIMO, This way!,male
PROXIMO, Where did you get those scars?,male
PROXIMO, Are you a soldier?,male
PROXIMO, Do you speak? -- KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME!,male
PROXIMO, That's enough.,male
PROXIMO," Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of gladiators.  You live and die at my pleasure.",male
PROXIMO, Here you will be trained in the art of combat.  Here you will be given the tools to survive.  Please my patrons in the arena and all the gifts of the world will be showered upon you.  Imagine riches beyond your paltry dreams of riches! Imagine fame beyond your rude understanding of the word!  All this can belong to the select few who prove their worth in the arena.,male
PROXIMO, If... on the other hand... you disappoint me... you will be dismembered and fed to my jackals limb by limb.,male
PROXIMO, And my jackals are always hungry.,male
PROXIMO," In this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Be remembered proudly.",male
PROXIMO, No... ... give the Spaniard to him.  Give the Scribe to Vibius.,male
PROXIMO," And keep them moving, their lungs aren't strong, ground the spears as soon as you can and then go for the ax-men.  If you get all four there's an extra bonus so don't be distracted by the Spartans...",male
PROXIMO, Perhaps you'd like a woman?,male
PROXIMO, Boy?,male
PROXIMO, Gold?,male
PROXIMO," Well, I have nothing left to offer you!  A man who turns down a butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold confuses me.",male
PROXIMO," You fight like a soldier.  You have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns.  You eye the world around you like an enemy. What is your name, Roman soldier?",male
PROXIMO," Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well you shall have her, Gladiator.  The new Emperor has ordered a series of matches to culminate in a grand spectacle.  If you do well I shall become very, very rich.  If you do well enough I shall set you free. Is it freedom you want?",male
PROXIMO, Not even that.,male
PROXIMO, Except... If one has proven oneself in battle.  If at the end of the games you are the final man standing -- the Emperor will present you with a small wooden sword.  The sword is your freedom.,male
PROXIMO," All right, Gladiator.  We shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures.  The Great Whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can't suck another drop. That is Rome.",male
PROXIMO, Die well and we'll sing songs about you for a generation.,male
PROXIMO, How did you know?,male
PROXIMO, Now I am just an entertainer.,male
PROXIMO, But I tell you -- if you survive this madness I want you to go into business with me.  I'll give you a quarter of my holdings.,male
PROXIMO, Come --,male
VIBIUS, Be still.,male
VIBIUS, You point the sharp end at your opponent and you shove it in his guts.,male
VIBIUS, Proximo!  You insult me with this carrion!  Chain him to someone else!,male
VIBIUS, MOVE ASIDE!  THIS IS A TABLE FOR MEN!,male
VIBIUS, Not what you expected?,male
VIBIUS, Rome is nothing but a slaughter house.  And we are the meat.,male
VIBIUS, Tradition.  He watches over us.,male
VIBIUS, You didn't kill him.,male
VIBIUS, We'll be killed.,male
VIBIUS, You didn't know my ancestors.  A rotten bunch.,male
VIBIUS," If I die, I want a hundred whores at my funeral.",male
VIBIUS," Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these Roman dogs how gladiators fight!",male
GRACCHUS, We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter and it is spreading... we have looting at the granaries... we have so much filth in the Tiber that the water is undrinkable... we have Praetorian Guard units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the exchange - -,male
GRACCHUS, Rome dies as the Emperor plays at beneficence.  At least Nero gave us music!,male
GRACCHUS, It is his duty to hear the will of the Senate.,male
GRACCHUS," Darling children, to be sure, now if I may proceed?",male
GRACCHUS," Caesar, your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars.  We would like to --",male
GRACCHUS," With respect, sire, the people don't need love -- they need law. The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city -- -- starting with basic sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could study this and --",male
GRACCHUS, The Senate is the people.,male
GRACCHUS," Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?",male
GRACCHUS, You want to hold games?,male
GRACCHUS," If I may, Caesar... how are you going to pay for this?",male
GRACCHUS," Respectfully, sire, taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the Senate --",male
GRACCHUS, No... it's not...,male
GRACCHUS," We've taking a sounding, the Senate is with us.",male
GRACCHUS, But we are only words.  We are air. We need steel.,male
GRACCHUS," Well, can they at least be rented for a day?",male
GRACCHUS," Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing.",male
GRACCHUS, For you prince Lucius... a sea monster!,male
GRACCHUS, Show me on the map.,male
GRACCHUS," You're welcome, Prince Anthill!",male
GRACCHUS, Peace child... One dark night the Gods will light our path.  They will give us the voice we need. Have faith in that.  Have faith.,male
GRACCHUS, About half.  But once the tyrant is dead.  All.,male
GRACCHUS, We should fear for the blackest storm.,male
GRACCHUS," I only have one question for you, General... Why?",male
GRACCHUS, That's not the reason.  Tell me the truth.,male
GRACCHUS, I knew the old man well.  And I loved him very much.  In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together.  After he went to the wars and lost his way... I was very cruel.  I tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of.,male
GRACCHUS, You can have no idea how much that means to me.,male
GRACCHUS," General, the purple is yours if you so desire.  The Senate will support you.",male
GRACCHUS, Not to mention the damn traffic!,male
GRACCHUS, He knows who Rome is.  Rome is the mob.  He will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted. And he will takes their lives.  And he will take their freedom.  And still they will roar.  The beating heart of Rome isn't the marble of the Senate. It's the sand of the Colosseum.  He will give them death.  And they will love him for it.,male
GRACCHUS," Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians they come across... now, where is Achaea?",male
GRACCHUS, I want to meet him.,male
GRACCHUS, You will lead an army of your brothers on Rome.  Many will die. Why?,male
GRACCHUS," Any man who will die for a whispered dream deserves my respect.  I honor you, General.",male
LUCIUS, I heard voices...,male
LUCIUS, Senator!  What did you bring me?!,male
LUCIUS, Below Macedonia!,male
LUCIUS," Thank you, Senator Mountain!",male
LUCIUS, I saw you fight.  The Carthage battle too.  I've never seen so much courage.,male
LUCIUS, My father was killed.,male
LUCIUS, He still comes to me in my dreams. Do you have a father?,male
LUCIUS, I hope he comes to you in your dreams.  My father and I ride horses in mine.,male
LUCIUS, I've been reading too.,male
LUCIUS, She killed herself with a snake!,male
LUCIUS," I don't know, Uncle.",male
LUCIUS, What is that fire?,male
VIBIUS," Oh go on, it won't kill you.",male
