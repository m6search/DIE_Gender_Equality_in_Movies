CLARK," Atlantis, what's the problem?",male
CLARK, What the hell was that?,male
CLARK, The press is going to want answers. What are we going to say?,male
CLARK," A big asteroid. E.T.A., eighteen days. A lot bigger than the five mile one that obliterated the dinosaurs.",male
CLARK," Three things the Russians make well, guys - vodka, gymnasts and rockets. Don't count 'em out.",male
CLARK," United States astronauts train for eighteen months. You have nine days. Officers Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are your military instructors and the only pilots to have flown the spacecraft. Each is a combat decorated officer and among the finest men and women we have in the service. Pay attention to them.",male
CLARK, You will vomit.  Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your heads. You'll be so tired you can't eat but that won't matter 'cause you'll be so sore you can't take a dump. By the way...good morning.,male
CLARK, We've got to warn.,male
CLARK," Lookin' real good, Freedom.",male
CLARK," Freedom, Independence. You're looking good. Prepare to start docking procedures at the MIR.",male
CLARK," How we doin', Freedom, over?",male
CLARK," You're on your own, Willie. You've got to raise your velocity 17 thousand miles an hour or you won't catch the target, over.",male

GOLDEN," We got the top scientific minds in the world working on this. Try ""whacking"" the thing.",male
GOLDEN, Nothing. Not until we know what happened.,male
GOLDEN," I am secure. Go ahead, General.",male
GOLDEN, When?,male
GOLDEN," Tell the president it's called ""budget cuts."" We don't have enough telescopes to track the skies.",male
GOLDEN, I don't know. We'll figure it out.,male
GOLDEN, Fly a team up to New York. Contact every Space Watch facility in the,male
GOLDEN, Did we find who made the phone call last night?,male
GOLDEN," Copies to the Pentagon, Colorado Space Command, and the Washington",male
GOLDEN," Okay guys, one of the worst days in N.A..S.A history just got worse. Ten million to one. A rogue comet came from deep space and collided with an asteroid. Some kids actually got a picture of the collision event and told no one. The stuff that hit this morning was the collision's forward- thrown matter, mere pebbles from what's about to come. Walter?",male
GOLDEN, The size of Texas.,male
GOLDEN, How many of you are as scared as I am?,male
GOLDEN," One giant leap for Mankind. Everyone remember that? This is what we are going to do. We're going to fly to that asteroid with a nuclear device, implant it and get off before it blows. Quincy?",male
GOLDEN, You're all looking at us like we're crazy. We're not.,male
GOLDEN," What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national security and could land me in jail, but in eighteen days there arnt' gonna be any jails, so shuttle. Gentlemen, I'm talking about the X-71.",male
GOLDEN," Time is our enemy. This is like the race to the Moon, guys - what this Agency was founded on.",male
GOLDEN," Quincy's been working on excavating the ice from the Moon - he's gonna reorient his thinking. Right, Quince?",male
GOLDEN," I don't care who he is, what he's doing.",male
GOLDEN," It's the late 20th century, I run the U.S. Space Program, and I'm praying to God the Russians are better at this than we are",male
GOLDEN," So, where's our oil driller?",male
GOLDEN," Mister Stamper.. Dan Golden, I'm Director of --",male
GOLDEN, That was a long time ago. I run this place now. And we've got a serious problem on our hands that Quincy here thinks you might be able to help us out with --,male
GOLDEN, I wonder if we might speak alone?,male
GOLDEN, Okay.,male
GOLDEN," Move it along, Quincy.",male
GOLDEN," Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in a difficult place.",male
GOLDEN," Not...this place. This is really out there. Space, Mister Stamper.",male
GOLDEN, We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a nuclear device in it's core. To do that we need to drill an eight hundred foot hole.,male
GOLDEN," All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm, any help you can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of course.",male
GOLDEN, Ten million.,male
GOLDEN," Gentlemen, gentlemen, wait a second. The crux of the matter",male
GOLDEN, Or three,male
GOLDEN, You won't need one. You're not going up.,male
GOLDEN, Harry. Let's figure this out.,male
GOLDEN," The deal was for you, not others.",male
GOLDEN, It's out of the question.,male
GOLDEN, What kind of men are these?,male
GOLDEN," This is getting us nowhere. Can they fly, or not?",male
GOLDEN," We need to drill. Do you know how to drill, colonel? Neither do I. They're going up.",male
GOLDEN," General, it's our job to get them ready to go into space. They're there to do the drilling. And Colonel Sharp, we all have families.",male
GOLDEN, This is like putting the Hell's Angels in space.,male
GOLDEN, Projected impact tracking. I need stats!,male
GOLDEN, Warn who? The whole South Pacific?,male
GOLDEN," Stamper, answer me one question - have you ever let anyone down?",male
GOLDEN," ....and the two pieces will slide right past us. You cannot shatter it. Getting hit with 20 smaller asteroids is as bad as one big one. You have to drill, plant the nuke, lift off, and detonate -- all before the asteroid reaches this position. You have eight hours. Remember it. You must detonate by this point or, the two halves will hit us.",male
GOLDEN,,male
GOLDEN," These guys are fast. Harry, interior gauge check.",male
GOLDEN, A.J.'s off the team. We need a list of names from you to fill the slot.,male
GOLDEN, We don't want independent thinkers. And we don't need heroes. We need a team.,male
GOLDEN, One shot. Pull him in line or send him home.,male
GOLDEN," In the book of Revalations, the Bible speaks of a final day on Earth, when all mankind shall perish, shall cease to exist. This day is known as Armageddon.",male
GOLDEN," When you meet the Russian, you might want to go easy on the guy.",male
GOLDEN," I work for the President of the United States. But I think it's my duty as a scientist to tell the world what is happening. Three, days ago a manned space mission was sent to intercept an asteroid which has entered the Earth's orbit. This is a difficult mission. In all frankness, it is the most difficult mission anyone has ever flown. A little over fifty years ago we sent our Armed Forces half-way around the world to save the world from an evil empire that threatened mass extinction. The men and women of this nation united, answered the calland preserved our freedom. Once again we face a threat to our way of life. And once again we look to our military to preserve our future. The men and women selected to lead this mission are America's finest and most decorated career officers in the military. Our hopes and prayers are with them. Thank you.",male
GOLDEN, We'll do your best.,male
GOLDEN," They'll be pullin' nine and half G's for eleven minutes, General.",male
GOLDEN, If they're still alive.,male
GOLDEN," Come on, Willie, you can do this",male
GOLDEN," Willie? Come in, over. Willie, can you hear me...?",male
GOLDEN, Freedom. come in.,male
GOLDEN, What's the problem?,male
GOLDEN, How much deeper?,male
GOLDEN," Harry, your fault line's fifty yards off the starboard side.",male
GOLDEN," Yeah, Harry. What's your situation?",male
GOLDEN, You're forty minutes in. You should be down 150 feet. How far are you?,male
GOLDEN," ""Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can."" Remember that, Stamper? Go faster.",male
GOLDEN, How?,male
GOLDEN, What is going on up there?,male
GOLDEN, After 15 minutes? What do you expect?,male
GOLDEN," A surface detonation isn't going to do it, General. My scientists have already told you that. It must be detonated inside the asteroid. The alternative is that the Earth will be bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as catastrophic.",male
GOLDEN, The asteroid's surface is heating up.,male
GOLDEN, It means they may not be able to work on the surface for much longer. The temperatures will be unbearable.,male
GOLDEN, Say nothing.,male
GOLDEN, Now just get the thing in the hole.,male
GOLDEN," Harry, c'mon, we got thirty minutes.",male
GOLDEN, Is he alright?,male
GOLDEN, The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote detonator is not functional. One of the crew is going to stay behind and,male
GOLDEN, Don't stay for this.,male
GOLDEN," Stamper, you gave me your word. You have five seconds. PRESS THE BUTTON!",male
GOLDEN," Where are they, Flip? Give me some angles, give me some directions, give me speeds...",male
GOLDEN, I just want to tell you I'm proud to know the daughter of the man who just saved the world.,male
JIMBO, When are we going to let N.A.S.A in on what we've found?,male
JIMBO," Yeah, but this is their sandbox were playing in.",male
JIMBO," Hell with them, I'm going on Howard Stern",male
JIMBO, Call N.A.S.A,male
JIMBO," I have the number. I got it from ""Mega monster.""",male
JIMBO," He's some super-hacker, I went to high school with. Guy's totally wired into every encrypted government installation.",male
JIMBO, They never proved he shut down the power in those seven states.,male
JIMBO, I got mission control,male
JIMBO," Uhh hi, I'm an astronomer in Kentucky, and I was wondering if you guys had seen some strange activity in the southern middle quadrant of the asteroid belt between Antares Major and Epsilom Scorpio",male
JIMBO, My name? Uhh,male
JIMBO, Lexington... Massachusetts.,male
JIMBO," So, that N.A.S.A. guy wasn't kiddin; about bein' arrested and",male
JIMBO," Yes, absolutely, yes sir.",male
JIMBO, Him.,male
JIMBO," I was calling the Houston area code, which is 713. I was calling 712, which is outside Spokane, Washington, where my Aunt Zelda",male
JIMBO, Our math must've been off! we thought it was gonna pass the Earth!,male
JIMBO," Hey, zipperheads! Ever watch ""L.A. Law?"" Right to remain silent, right to an attorney? My brother's a badass lawyer - he's gonna sue your asses to Mars. I was in pre-law for a month - you can't put somebody in jail for makin' a phone call!!!",male
JIMBO," Yeah, that's why they were so hot for the co-ordinates. Do you think it's an asteroid? Or comet?",male
JIMBO, If it's over then why aren't you lettin' us out of this goddamn cell?,male
JIMBO," Don't walk away, I want to talk to my lawyer. You hear me?",male
JIMBO, He flunked the bar three times.,male
JIMBO, This definitely doesn't look like a glamorous job.,male
THEO," We don't even know what we have yet. Comet, asteroid - it could be anything up there. And don't be so eager to red flag N.A.S.A. They don't call us when they discover anything.",male
THEO," This is our discovery. We're going to hold a press conference. We're going to be famous. SPACEWATCH'll name this thing after us. Job offers are going to fly in from all the big companies. J.P.L., that think tank up at M.I.T., hell even N.A.S.A. 'll be chasing us.",male
THEO, How?,male
THEO," And say what? ""Hi, we're a couple astronomer geeks who found something really bitchin; floatin' in space."" You can't just call N.A.S.A.  It's like calling the White House. Besides, you'll never get the number.",male
THEO, He's also an ex-con.,male
THEO, Hang up! Hang up now!,male
THEO, Lexington.. uhh...Massachusettes. Idiot. I told you not to call them.,male
THEO, Him.,male
THEO, It's our discovery. No way.,male
THEO, Something they're not telling the public.,male
THEO, I dunno - but I bet it's a whopper.,male
THEO, Southern Hemisphere?,male
THEO, I'm hungry! When're we gonna eat?,male
FLIP," Yeah, Mission Control.",male
FLIP, Who is this?,male
FLIP, This is a restricted line. How did you get it? Where are you?,male
FLIP, Can you tell me the exact co- ordinates..?,male
FLIP, The F.B.I.'s on it.,male
FLIP, Look it that sucker. They got a nuke up there in sixteen hours?,male
FLIP, Yeah. That Russian monkey in 1957.,male
FLIP, Engine ignition. Starting diagnostics.,male
FLIP," Nine hundred and eighty...Nine ninety...they're into the fault, they're doing it.",male
FLIP, The new courses are miss us!,male
TEMPLE, Get me Dan Goldman on the secure phone.,male
TEMPLE," I'm going to brief the President. What's going on here, Dan? Why didn't we have warning?",male
TEMPLE, Is it over?,male
TEMPLE," Dan, we're all here. Tell us what we're up against.",male
TEMPLE," Well, that's really positive, Dan. The President just got off the phone with the Russians. They're just about to launch a new Mars Probe on the biggest rocket in the world.",male
TEMPLE, They're going to pull off the probe and replace it with four Atlas Class IV nuclear warheads. Enough punch in their opinion - not to break it up - but to slow it down enough to miss Earth's orbit.,male
TEMPLE, They're going to move it up.,male
TEMPLE, Sixteen hours from now.,male
TEMPLE," Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan.",male
TEMPLE," You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about the meteor shower? What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be over.",male
TEMPLE," Of course, completely in order. What is the price?",male
TEMPLE," Mr. Stamper, this mission is to preserve the future of",male
TEMPLE, Done.,male
TEMPLE," I'll call the I.R.S., try to uhm, explain the situation.",male
TEMPLE," You want us to buy that, too?",male
TEMPLE, Rock what? Is that a dog?,male
TEMPLE," With my stars came the power to be blunt.  These drillers are not trained for this, Dan.",male
TEMPLE," If they can't drill this hole, my men are going to take over.",male
TEMPLE, Anyone done that before?,male
TEMPLE, This is an exercise in futility.,male
TEMPLE," Your drillers aren't doing the job, Dan.",male
TEMPLE," Golden, we are preparing for surface detonation.",male
TEMPLE," We have a lot better chance of surviving the ""smaller matter.""  The drillers have two hours I want you ready on my command.",male
TEMPLE, What does that mean?,male
TEMPLE," Golden, tell your drillers the clock is ticking. I have 6 billion people down here relying on them!",male
TEMPLE, In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. Your father better be a man of his word.,male
TEMPLE," Well, find a solution!!",male
TEMPLE, STAMPER DETONATE!,male

TEMPLE," Sharp, I NEED A SOLUTION!",male
GOLDEN, world. We gotta find what part of the sky this is coming from.,male
GOLDEN," office. We gotta compute size, composition, speed, impact point WE SEE the photo -- A HUGE ASTEROID",male
GOLDEN," Okay, who?",male
GOLDEN," Right now, that day conflicts with six billion schedules. For the first time in the history of this planet, s species possesses the technology to prevent it's own extinction. I've been with N.A.S.A. my entire adult life. Eleven years as an astronaut, another fifteen on the ground at Mission Control. Twenty- six years I've had to answer one question -- why? Why more money? Why the race for space? Why do we need to know what is up there? When we come through this, I'll take comfort in the fact that I won't ever have to answer those questions again. You are our warriors up there. You are our last hope. God be with you.",male
GOLDEN," Independence, come in. Come in, Freedom.",male
SKIP, I'll call J.P.L. and get the Hubble telescope on it.,male
SKIP," Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow.",male
SKIP, It's done?,male
SKIP," Boss, we're good at space travel, but you're talkin' about drilling a hole.",male
SKIP, It'll never fly. Never.,male
SKIP," Twenty seconds till we lose radio contact, Director.",male
SKIP, No cabin pressure! Systems-wide failure!,male
SKIP," They overshot their landing 26 miles. There's a different fault line, but it's deeper.",male
SKIP, Two hundred feet.,male
SKIP, Look at these thermals. This is BEFORE sunlight hits the drill site.  She's really heating up,male
SKIP, They just lost the rig. The hole blew out.,male
SKIP," Dan, the surface is heating up!",male
SKIP," She's gettin' hotter! Gotta mean gas - methane, helium, probably water vapor.",male
SKIP, It's a mess up there...!,male
SKIP, They got Freedom goin'!,male
SKIP, Director? It's Mr. Stamper. He wants to talk to his daughter.,male
SKIP, The thrusters are down! 32 seconds.,male
GOLDEN," In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force of all the nuclear weapons in the world, times a thousand. Half our population will die within 24 hours from tidal waves and heat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the end, it will be men eating the flesh of other men. It's not the end of the world, General, the world -Earth - will still be here. But there will be no life - maybe cockroaches and some resilient strands of bacteria.",male
GOLDEN, With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe in '96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa.,male
GOLDEN, Their launch date is set for next month.,male
GOLDEN, To when?,male
GOLDEN," What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together? Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear detonation is not going to work.  The only way is to split the thing in half and hope the two pieces slide past us.",male
GOLDEN," Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing to do unless you have the exact co- ordinates. There are only twelve telescopes powerful enough to see it right now. You've got a full moon goin' for four days - makes it all but impossible to see.. Once these things draw closer to Earth, you'll never keep a lid on this. No way.",male
GOLDEN, How's she look?,male
GOLDEN," Negative, A.J. Don't exceed ix thousand. Not on this run.",male
GOLDEN," Negative, A.J.",male
GOLDEN," A.J., shut the Armadillo down now.",male
GOLDEN, Firmly.,male
GOLDEN," If we're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk about time...and temperature. Zero Barrier's in two hours.",male
GOLDEN," Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius",male
GOLDEN, We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long.  The clock is ticking...,male
GOLDEN, Three hundred and fifty degrees.,male
GOLDEN," Go ahead, Harry.",male
QUINCY," Look, set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a third degree burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious damage. If we can get a nuke deep in one of the asteroid's fault lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond.",male
QUINCY, Has been for three months.,male
QUINCY, Right. And the first thing I'm gonna do is talk to the guy I ripped off. His name is Harry S. Stamper. He's the best oil driller in the world.,male
QUINCY, He's here.,male
QUINCY," I'm a big fan, Mr. Stamper.",male
QUINCY, Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50 thousand feet. They said it couldn't be done. You did it. Incredible.,male
QUINCY," Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost expert in deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high speed bits, drilling fluids, downhole motors.  Can I call you Harry?",male
QUINCY," The ""Armadillo"" - our fourth generation rover. It carries a six- cell solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint venture with the Germans. It's designed by Porsche.",male
QUINCY, This baby works without one.,male
QUINCY, It works through a series of complexly designed differential gears.,male
QUINCY," ""Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics,"" by Harry S. Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent Office last year.",male

QUINCY, That's so simple it's brilliant.,male
QUINCY," The new generation EMU - Extravehicular Mobility Unit - provides oxygen for seven hours, a pressurised enclosure, and temperate control. The gloves and helmet slide on and lock with a twist, like this. The cap is worn underneath. It contains a mike and headphones for two-way communication.  We'll be able to see you from a small video cam mounted inside the helmet. The Undergarment has 300 feet of plastic tubing circulating cooling water. Owen...",male
QUINCY, Where' it headed? How big?,male
QUINCY, We'll run your liquid oxygen from the shuttle through a tube into the intake manifold. No problem.,male
A.J., What did our always-at-lunch-Swedish geologist say?,male
A.J., What's his mood?,male
A.J.," I'm on top of it Harry, you have a second?",male
A.J., I'll hurry. I've worked for you for a long time.,male
A.J., And you've been real good to me,male
A.J.," No. The reason I am here, today, standing here, talking to you. I'm obviously talking to you...but it's, you know, not, uhh...it's not an oil- related matter exactly",male

A.J.," You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't do the first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...! I got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk to him, but try it on.",male
A.J.," Good plan, Harry.",male
A.J.," I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry --",male
A.J.," No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve",male
A.J.," Wouldn't miss it, Harry.",male
A.J.," Chick, Max! Mack truck tranny!",male
A.J., I figured out how to bring up the slag. Direct the jet turbine's exhaust down the drill pipe. It'll blow the stuff right up the hole.,male
A.J., Let's see what this baby can do.,male
A.J., We can do better. I'm increasing the RPM's to seven thousand. We can get more torque.,male
A.J., Relax. I built this thing. She's got more in her. Increasing the RPM's.,male

HARRY, The same way you did when you blow- dried your hair this morning.,male
HARRY, Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave me 57 mil. to find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do! 'cause they have no lives!,male

HARRY, This is my Patent.,male

HARRY, Hang on. I betcha everyone in this room has a PH.D.,male
HARRY," I left school after tenth grade. I earned my PH.D every day offshore drilling holes. You can't get it in a book. Drilling holes is about instinct - about smellin' it. Drillin' holes is an art. You want the crux of the matter? You stole my patent, and you don't have a goddamn idea how to use it. As for this piece o' crap, don't insult me. I'll rebuild it - the right way - and drill the hole for you.",male
HARRY, Just give me a space suit.,male
HARRY, You don't have a choice. I think all you PH.D's know that.,male
HARRY," First of all, you're going to buy my patent.",male

HARRY, I'm only as good as the men I work with. The ones in those home movies of yours.,male
HARRY, My chief tool pusher. You game A.J.?,male
HARRY," And my roughnecks, Roustabouts, and Rockhound?",male
HARRY," No. Just a meek, geek geophysicist.",male
HARRY," It's a job, like any other. Just a different location.",male
HARRY, I'd rather die up there fighting this thing than sit here waiting for it.,male
HARRY," Charles, but if you call him that, he'll kill you.",male
HARRY," With all due respect, Doctor, I don't know too army guys who are social when someone is trying to jam a tube up their butt.",male
HARRY, A lot of people take sedatives.,male
HARRY, I don't tell my men how to live their lives. They're with me to do a job and they do it well.,male
HARRY, That Armadillo car. Get it in here.,male
HARRY, How were you going to power your drill arm?,male
HARRY," I need to be able to start and stop. I need different speeds, and I need reverse.",male
HARRY," It can if it's hooked up to a clutch. A.J., get me a Mack truck transmission.",male
HARRY, I'm a simple man. But don't underestimate me.,male
HARRY, I've got a thing about flying.,male
HARRY, I hate to fly. I hate to fly. I hate it so much.,male
HARRY, Forty thousand people died last night. But I guess that didn't concern any of you. I hope you all had a good time last night.,male
HARRY," Well, you should be scared. We all should be. 'Cause if we fail, they say the Earth will die.",male
HARRY," You think these N.A.S.A. guys are a bunch of clean-cut pussies, that's it. They can out think you, they can outrun you. This job, gentlemen, is as real as it gets. I need every one of you. If you're not up to it, then walkout of that door.",male
HARRY," Good, A.J. Good.",male
HARRY," From all of your intel, the deepest fault line is here.",male
HARRY," You just worry about getting me on that rock, Colonel. Let me worry about the drilling.",male
HARRY, Done!,male
HARRY, We're on A.J.,male
HARRY," Lose the helmet, A.J.",male
HARRY,,male
HARRY," Torque adjuster's good. Fuel level good. A.J., downhole pressure?",male
HARRY, A.J. would be the first name on my list.,male
HARRY, You have to have confidence in the men you send up. I understand that. But I'm the one that has to land on that rock. Not you. I pick my own team.,male
HARRY, You tell me what the hell you think you're doing?,male
HARRY, Bullshit. You're trying to lead this team. You're trying to be me.  You're not me.,male
HARRY," If you can't bury this cowboy shit, yeah, I want you to quit.",male
HARRY," I listen to N.A.S.A., you listen to me. That's the chain. Either you follow it, or you're done.",male
HARRY," I stood up for you, because I've made a life of proving people wrong.",male
HARRY," When I was about your age, I was in Galveston, Texas.  I scraped together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land. I set up a rig and drilled my first hole. Then I sat there and watched her soak up the sun for six months -waiting for this baby to pop.  Everybody told me to quit. I wouldn't listen. My wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody in town thought I was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the last hour of the last day, she popped. She spit out that black gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian. I captured the magic. This is the last piece of pipe that struck gold that day.",male
HARRY," You know I was thinking, Gracie. Over the years, I should have patted you on the back more",male
HARRY," No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie. I want you to know that.",male
HARRY," I love you too, Gracie.",male
HARRY, Sixty pounds.,male
HARRY, Wait here.,male
HARRY, Hey you. Yeah you. Come here.,male
HARRY, What's all this crap?,male
HARRY, We don't need music and we don't mind dirty utensils.,male
HARRY, Unhook the shuttles.,male
HARRY, Did A.J. make it?,male
HARRY, How beautiful it is. Thinkin' about all that oil I sucked out and spit into the air.Funny how a man can live 46 years and realize he ain't been doing the right thing.,male
HARRY," I hate to fly, I hate to fly, I hate to fly",male
HARRY, It did happen. They're gone. Deal with it. We got a lot of work to do.,male
HARRY, Rockhound.,male
HARRY, I'm gonna get you some surface samples and you're gonna tell me what I'm up against.,male

HARRY, What do you make of that?,male
HARRY, Iron deposit?,male
HARRY, Give me Dan Golden.,male
HARRY, Situation? You put me down on the worst possible place on this asteroid. I'm drillin' into something I shouldn't. The hole just ate one of my diamond-tipped bits in thirty minutes. That has never happened to me in twenty years.,male
HARRY, Not far. Twenty-three feet.,male
HARRY, We will.,male
HARRY, How far?,male
HARRY, Increase r.p.m.,male
HARRY, We gotta get more power down to this bit. Full throttle.,male
HARRY," Yeah, I'm sure.",male
HARRY, She's gonna have to.,male
HARRY," I don't have time to argue, Chick, now goddamn it, throttle up, or I'll come up there and do it for you.",male
HARRY, Stop!,male
HARRY, We're goin' to the second rig.,male
HARRY," Why don't we cut to the chase, fellahs? What the fuck is going on with that other nuke?",male
HARRY," Well, it wasn't my scientists that told me about the fucking fire cracker inside the hand story. Are we detonating on the surface or are we gonna drill?",male
HARRY, We're drilling.,male
HARRY, ...You told me that the only way to deal with this hunk 'o crud is to get a nuke 1000 feet down. You sticking with that?,male
HARRY, Great. Glad we have that understanding.,male
HARRY, Wait...wait..what about temperature? When did temperatures come into the picture?,male
HARRY, And...? How hot is it going to get?,male
HARRY, How hot is it going to get?!,male
HARRY," Thanks for telling us now, Golden don't think my bits can handle those kind of temperatures",male
HARRY," Give me some more good news. You've got two new assistants who can fix your shuttle. Bear, Max, hop to it. There's not a machine they can't fix. We can handle the hole from here.",male
HARRY," Colonel Sharp, if we're going to blow this hole, you gotta help ME. I need some more manpower",male
