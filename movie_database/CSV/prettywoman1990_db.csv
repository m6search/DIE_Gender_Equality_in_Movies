914,BRIDGET," What's your name, dear?",1,female,True
915,BRIDGET," Well, the mini—skirt is dead, Vivian. I don't care how many designers try to bring it back, it's dead.  Goodness, you look a like a streetwalker in that. Let's find you something else.  Come on.",1,female,True
916,BRIDGET," Where are you from, dear?",1,female,True
917,BRIDGET, No wonder.  How about this?,1,female,True
918,BRIDGET, Like a pastel?,1,female,True
919,BRIDGET, These should fit.,1,female,True
920,BRIDGET, Don't you like the dress?,1,female,True
921,BRIDGET," Then we'll just have to change you, won't we?  We have a salon on the third floor. You can get your hair, nails and make-up done a tad more conservatively.",1,female,True
922,BRIDGET, Of course.  By the time you get back to Nebraska they'll think you were born in Beverly Hills.  Ask for Thane.,1,female,True
923,BRIDGET, There we go.  Take a breath.,1,female,True
924,BRIDGET, Your uncle will like this.,1,female,True
925,BRIDGET, They never are.,1,female,True
1036,CARL, … and we want to continue to do business with you but the M & A market is changing.  People have been scared off by the negative press on high yield bonds.  And with the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings more tempting to offset increased risks.,1,male,True
1037,CARL, Then go to a bank.,1,male,True
1038,CARL, Not yet.,1,male,True
1039,CARL," Bill, if you're going to liquidate the company that quickly why is eighteen such a problem…",1,male,True
1040,CARL, As far as I can tell you're already there.  You've got a fifteen percent situation in a troubled stock and you need to make a bid.  I don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have.,1,male,True
1088,CHUCK, You're sure a good looking piece.,1,male,True

464,EDWARD, How do I get to Wilshire Boulevard?,1,male,True
465,EDWARD, I'm lost.  How do I get to Wilshire?,1,male,True
466,EDWARD," Actually, I just want directions.",1,male,True
467,EDWARD, I can see that.  But perhaps you'd make an exception.,1,male,True
468,EDWARD, A bargain.,1,male,True
469,EDWARD, All I have is a twenty…,1,male,True
470,EDWARD, How do I get to Wilshire?,1,male,True
471,EDWARD," You're a lovely young lady, but I'm not in the habit of picking up girls off the street.  Now…",1,male,True
472,EDWARD, You're a very persuasive woman. It happens that I am alone tonight…,1,male,True
473,EDWARD, A hundred dollars.  For the whole night?,1,male,True
474,EDWARD," You're quite a negotiator.  Alright.  I can't believe I'm doing this, but climb in.",1,male,True
475,EDWARD, It's rented.,1,male,True
476,EDWARD, Edward.  What's your's?,1,male,True
477,EDWARD, I'm staying in a hotel in Beverly Hills.,1,male,True
478,EDWARD, New York.,1,male,True
479,EDWARD, It's alright.  Are you going to tell me how to get to Wilshire?,1,male,True
480,EDWARD, Business.,1,male,True
481,EDWARD, You certainly ask a lot of questions.,1,male,True
482,EDWARD," Listen, my overcoat's in the back seat. Why don't you put it on?",1,male,True
483,EDWARD, Let's just say you're a little over— dressed for this hotel.,1,male,True
484,EDWARD, It's not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.,1,male,True
485,EDWARD," Perhaps so.  But if this hotel has any hookers, they don't look like they're…",1,male,True
486,EDWARD, Exactly.,1,male,True
487,EDWARD, Penthouse.,1,male,True
488,EDWARD, Room Service….  I'd like a bottle of the house champagne and a bowl of chilled strawberries sent to my room. Thank you.,1,male,True
489,EDWARD, Nice view?,1,male,True
490,EDWARD, I've impressed you?,1,male,True
491,EDWARD, Very good.,1,male,True
492,EDWARD," As I recall, you where the one that picked me up.",1,male,True
493,EDWARD, It started to seem like a good idea.,1,male,True
494,EDWARD," Cruising?  Hmmm.  Well, I don't get to drive a lot in New York, so I thought it would be interesting to tool around and admire some of the local architecture.  I was sightseeing the Chinese Theater when I got lost and ran into you…",1,male,True
495,EDWARD, That should be the champagne.,1,male,True
496,EDWARD, That'll be fine.,1,male,True
497,EDWARD, I think he wanted you to tip him.,1,male,True
498,EDWARD, I'm afraid so.,1,male,True
499,EDWARD, Both.  This is the house brand.  I didn't think you'd mind.,1,male,True
500,EDWARD," More questions.  My wife divorced me years ago and is in Europe I believe, spending my money.  My girlfriend is in New York… spending my money.  Cheers.",1,male,True
501,EDWARD, I wish I could.  But I've got a liver problem.  I can't have any alcohol.,1,male,True
502,EDWARD, No.  I just like the smell.  Fond memories. How do you like it?,1,male,True
503,EDWARD, No.  Not tobacco or otherwise.,1,male,True
504,EDWARD, Try a strawberry.  It'll bring out the sweetness of the champagne.,1,male,True
505,EDWARD, Better?,1,male,True
506,EDWARD, I don't know.  Just being difficult.,1,male,True
507,EDWARD, You put it very well.  I'm a professional man and I'd like to find a professional woman.  Any more questions?,1,male,True
508,EDWARD, How about the bedroom?,1,male,True
509,EDWARD, Oh… yes.,1,male,True
510,EDWARD, I see.  I suppose you can't be too safe about that kind of thing.,1,male,True
511,EDWARD, What are you doing?,1,male,True
512,EDWARD, You could hang them in the closet.,1,male,True
513,EDWARD, Hey.  Slow down.  I thought we had the whole night.,1,male,True
514,EDWARD," Well, then I'm not like most guys.",1,male,True
515,EDWARD, Sorry.  What do you like?,1,male,True
516,EDWARD, I'm an incurable romantic.,1,male,True
517,EDWARD, What are you doing?,1,male,True
518,EDWARD, I thought we had all night.,1,male,True
519,EDWARD, You did.  But stay the night.  I'd like to sleep with you.  I'll get you a taxi in the morning.,1,male,True
520,EDWARD, Another question.  Because you're warm.,1,male,True
521,EDWARD, I don't snore.  I don't believe I snore.,1,male,True
522,EDWARD, That seems fair.,1,male,True
523,EDWARD," Cindy, I've had it.  This is the third time I've had to take a trip alone.",1,male,True
524,EDWARD, I don't care what your agent says.  One week isn't going to ruin your career.,1,male,True
525,EDWARD, I want you here.  You know how I get when I'm doing business.  Last night I even… … forget last night.  I want you on a flight today or it's over.,1,male,True
526,EDWARD, You promised me when you started this whole modeling thing that I would come first.  Now I'm still the one that's paying your bills and I'm not going to… Cindy!,1,male,True
527,EDWARD, Stupid girl!  That's it…,1,male,True
528,EDWARD, You're quite a sleeper.,1,male,True
529,EDWARD, Good morning.  Would you like some breakfast?,1,male,True
530,EDWARD, That must be an occupational hazard.,1,male,True
531,EDWARD, Would you like some breakfast?  It's still hot.,1,male,True
532,EDWARD, You should.  Come on.,1,male,True
533,EDWARD, Hair of the dog.,1,male,True
534,EDWARD, Just a bit.  With orange juice.  I guarantee it will make you feel better.,1,male,True
535,EDWARD, Don't you like anything?,1,male,True
536,EDWARD," Well, you're welcome to take a nice long bath.  The one in the bathroom is practically a pool.",1,male,True
537,EDWARD, I wanted to talk to you about that.,1,male,True
538,EDWARD, Crepes.,1,male,True
539,EDWARD," Vivian…  It's Vivian, right?",1,male,True
540,EDWARD," Vivian, I'm going to be in town until next Friday.  I'm involved in an important business deal and in the evenings I'll need to relax…",1,male,True
541,EDWARD," Hey, slow down.  I'm not going to take your plate away from you.",1,male,True
542,EDWARD," Actually, I was wondering if you would like to stay here for the week.",1,male,True
543,EDWARD," No, no, I'm not.  You're a very… professional woman.  And I like that. Rather than call you every night and wonder if you're available, I'd just as soon have you stay here.",1,male,True
544,EDWARD, How much?  Let's see if I can afford it.,1,male,True
545,EDWARD," Yes.  You can do what you want during the days, but I'd like to have you on call, so to speak.",1,male,True
546,EDWARD," Alright.  That seems fair.  Two thousand it is.  But let me tell you, I have very tough business to do.  There is a lot of pressure involved.  When I get tense, I need someone to help me relax.  That means no problems.  No hassles. Understand?",1,male,True
547,EDWARD, I'm not just talking about sex.  I need some nice pleasant company.,1,male,True
548,EDWARD, Fine.  But I will go.  This is only for a week.  I want you to be clear on that too.  I don't want you to have any expectations.  Sometimes these things get messy.,1,male,True
549,EDWARD," I wish my lawyer was that honest.  I wouldn't even risk this, except you seem a very sensible girl. Businesslike.  So it's a deal?",1,male,True
550,EDWARD," No, I want you to stay here while you're with me.  I don't want any trouble.  We'll buy anything you need. What do you want?",1,male,True
551,EDWARD, No.  No drugs.  Not while you're with me.,1,male,True
552,EDWARD, Champagne is legal.  Drugs are illegal. That's enough of a difference to me.,1,male,True
553,EDWARD, Then maybe this isn't going to work out.  I didn't know you were a drug addict.,1,male,True
554,EDWARD," That's fair.  Three thousand dollars for one week, no drugs, no strings attached.",1,male,True
555,EDWARD," Happy, huh?",1,male,True
556,EDWARD, I'm overpaying you.  Aren't I?,1,male,True
557,EDWARD, I don't think it will break me.,1,male,True
558,EDWARD, Good.  I've got to meet with some people.  I'll probably be gone most of the day.,1,male,True
559,EDWARD," I'm going to take a chance and trust you with this.  Buy some nice clothes on Rodeo Drive.  A few dresses, not too fancy, or too sexy.  Soft pinks and pastels are nice.  I just want you to look presentable in the hotel. Understand?",1,male,True
560,EDWARD," Well, let's hope you don't spend that much.",1,male,True
561,EDWARD," Be reasonable.  You're a smart girl. I'll make you a deal.  If you spend too much I'll send it all back at the end of the week.  If you're sensible, I'll let you keep it.  Fair?",1,male,True
562,EDWARD, 'Bye.,1,male,True
563,EDWARD, Then hold off until we file.,1,male,True
564,EDWARD," No, no.  I always play by the rules. There are too many people that would like to take me down.  I'm not about to give them any help.",1,male,True
565,EDWARD, Good to meet you.,1,male,True
566,EDWARD, What's that long building over there?,1,male,True
567,EDWARD, You what?,1,male,True
568,EDWARD, What kind of idiot are you?  You don't talk to anyone about this but me!,1,male,True
569,EDWARD, Where did you dig up this moron?,1,male,True
570,EDWARD, You people are supposed to be professionals.,1,male,True
571,EDWARD, No.  Don't bother.  He's probably already told everyone he knows.,1,male,True
572,EDWARD, Forget it.  Let's go up the coast.  I want to look around.,1,male,True
573,EDWARD, Bill!  Where the hell have you been?,1,male,True
574,EDWARD," Good, if your boys at the brokerage don't leak the whole deal.",1,male,True
575,EDWARD, Skip it.  Jake's going to be good from now on.  Aren't you?,1,male,True
576,EDWARD," Listen, there's something you need to look into right away.  There's a chemical treatment plant at that shipyard.  I want you to see if the permits are still valid. And what kind of limits are on them.",1,male,True
577,EDWARD, Don't get too excited yet.  Check the permits first.,1,male,True
578,EDWARD, Thanks for the tour.  Keep your mouths shut.  I'll see you tomorrow.,1,male,True
579,EDWARD, Ask them.  What's the offering looking like?,1,male,True
580,EDWARD, That's madness.  If I start paying rates like that I'll be out of business.  We've going to have to do better than that.,1,male,True
581,EDWARD, You're not listening to me.  We're going to do better than that.  Aren't we?,1,male,True
582,EDWARD, No.  That's all over.  I've lost my patience with her.,1,male,True
583,EDWARD," No, thanks.  I've already taken care of that side of my trip.  I met a pretty, no nonsense girl who's going to stay with me for the week.  She wants a third of what those pimps charge.",1,male,True
584,EDWARD," No, I was driving around the city and I found a… girl.",1,male,True
585,EDWARD," The girls you try to set me up with aren't virgins either, Bill.  I'm careful.",1,male,True
586,EDWARD, Drop it.,1,male,True
587,EDWARD," I don't need a girl who speaks French better than I do.  Those high class hookers are just high class leeches. I'm tired of them asking me to buy them jewels as tips.  I've found a nice, anonymous girl who's thrilled to provide me with sex at a fair rate with no hassles.  She's just a simple working girl and that's all I want.",1,male,True
588,EDWARD, Any messages?,1,male,True
589,EDWARD, Hello.,1,male,True
590,EDWARD, My niece?,1,male,True
591,EDWARD, I don't have a niece.,1,male,True
592,EDWARD, That pretty young girl in my room is a prostitute.,1,male,True
593,EDWARD, Do you have a problem with that?,1,male,True
594,EDWARD, Have some champagne sent up.  And a cheese tray or something.  Maybe a pâte and some bread.  A large bottle of mineral water. And strawberries.,1,male,True
595,EDWARD, You… you look different.,1,male,True
596,EDWARD," No, it's just that you look… different.",1,male,True
597,EDWARD," Yes.  Yes, I did.",1,male,True
598,EDWARD, You had your hair done.,1,male,True
599,EDWARD," No, no.  I'll pay for it.  You look wonderful.  Lovely.",1,male,True
600,EDWARD, Yes.,1,male,True
601,EDWARD," No, no, this is wonderful.  I just didn't think you…  you have great taste.",1,male,True
602,EDWARD, I do like it.  You look beautiful.,1,male,True
603,EDWARD, Thank you.  That's much better. I had an interesting talk with the hotel manager downstairs.,1,male,True
604,EDWARD," Listen to me.  I don't know what happened with you two, and I don't care.  I'm paying a lot for this room and as long as you're my guest, the people in this hotel will treat you like a queen.  If anyone hassles you, or makes you feel uncomfortable, you tell me.  Alright?  If I have to, I'll buy the hotel and burn it down to prove my point.",1,male,True
605,EDWARD, You want me to have him fired?,1,male,True
606,EDWARD, I'll see what I can do.  So did you buy anything else?,1,male,True
607,EDWARD, Only three dresses?,1,male,True
608,EDWARD, That's fine.  You were very frugal.,1,male,True
609,EDWARD, New underwear too?,1,male,True
610,EDWARD, Very much.,1,male,True
611,EDWARD, That's Room Service.,1,male,True
612,EDWARD, Cheers.,1,male,True
613,EDWARD, The good stuff?,1,male,True
614,EDWARD, Yes.,1,male,True
615,EDWARD," It's okay, it's okay.  I don't care what you spent.  I trust you.",1,male,True
616,EDWARD, Yes.  It's yours.,1,male,True
617,EDWARD," Better.  You're a lot better.  You're wonderful, Vivian.",1,male,True
618,EDWARD, Meet with lawyers and stockbrokers. Read financial reports.  It's pretty boring.,1,male,True
619,EDWARD, I'm acquiring a company.,1,male,True
620,EDWARD, It's called Kross Enterprises.  It used to build ships.  Nowadays it doesn't do much of anything.,1,male,True
621,EDWARD, Are you really curious?,1,male,True
622,EDWARD," All right.  Warn me if I bore you. Twenty years ago Kross was a huge corporation, and even though they're almost bankrupt today, they still have millions in assets.  Real estate, equipment, inventory.  Things that can be liquidated to generate cash.  You understand?",1,male,True
623,EDWARD," Anyhow, we figure Kross is worth about 400 million.  We hope we can acquire it for between two and three hundred million.  No matter what, I'm going to make a profit.  The question is how large.",1,male,True
624,EDWARD," Try is the key word there.  People have tried.  But not everyone can raise a few hundred million to toy around with .  And I know of assets the corporation owns that other people aren't aware of. It's worth more than most people think. Besides, the company management isn't particularly happy about being sold, because they'd be out of a job.",1,male,True
625,EDWARD, I wouldn't lose any sleep over them. They got the corporation into the mess it's in now.,1,male,True
626,EDWARD, Something like that.,1,male,True
627,EDWARD, It used to be easy.  The market crash and a few scandals have made things tougher.  And management has got smarter.  I have to be more careful about my targets now.,1,male,True
628,EDWARD," I guess… to get richer. I'm going to have to get dressed, I have a meeting at eight fifteen. Tomorrow I'll give you a lesson on short selling.",1,male,True
629,EDWARD, You're a good listener.  I like that.,1,male,True
630,EDWARD, How do I look?,1,male,True
631,EDWARD, Like a suit?  Very apt.  I feel like a suit.  I'll see you tonight.,1,male,True
632,EDWARD, It's not acceptable.,1,male,True
633,EDWARD, Draymen Heux has offered me seventy- five in the pool at sixteen and a half. I can secure the rest I need personally.,1,male,True
634,EDWARD," The market has changed, Carl.  There aren't many real players left.  I'll give you two hours to make a decision.",1,male,True
635,EDWARD, They can't know for sure.  They don't have time.  They'll do it for sixteen.,1,male,True
636,EDWARD, About what?,1,male,True
637,EDWARD, Alright.,1,male,True
638,EDWARD, I wouldn't miss it for the world.,1,male,True
639,EDWARD," No.  If the three of us sit down together then we might as well announce the takeover in the Wall Street Journal.  I'll meet him in public for dinner.  Less suspicious.  Tonight, if you can arrange it.  I'll even bring a girl.  That'll keep it all on a friendly level.",1,male,True
640,EDWARD, She can handle herself.  And I can handle Kross.,1,male,True
641,EDWARD, Sixteen.,1,male,True
642,EDWARD," We'll liven things up for you.  We're going out to dinner tonight.  I want you to look your best.  I don't think you have any clothes that will do.  Go buy something a little more formal.  Something dark and low cut.  But tasteful.  Spend whatever you have to.  If you don't know what to get, tell the salesgirl you're dining at the Rex.  And have your hair done up.  We're a little pushed for time so I'll meet you in the lobby at seven forty—five.  'Bye.",1,male,True
643,EDWARD, Then call the S.E.C.,1,male,True
644,EDWARD, Are you threatening me?,1,male,True
645,EDWARD," Really, Mr. Kross.  I don't think we have anything to talk about.  Maybe you should see my lawyer.",1,male,True
646,EDWARD," Let's go, Vivian.",1,male,True
647,EDWARD," Are you sure, Viv?",1,male,True
648,EDWARD, I didn't have to come here.  I don't have to talk to you.  If you have something to say you better say it without threatening me or insulting the lady.,1,male,True
649,EDWARD," I really don't know.  But from what I've heard, your company doesn't have any cash.",1,male,True
650,EDWARD, Then I'd be in a position of making your company a loan.  That doesn't seem to make much sense.,1,male,True
651,EDWARD," Mr. Kross, you're not going to be getting any Navy contracts.",1,male,True
652,EDWARD, Just that.  You're not going to be getting any new contracts from the military.  I know.,1,male,True
653,EDWARD, You flatter me if you think I can tell the Pentagon what to do.  But I do know you aren't getting the contract.,1,male,True
654,EDWARD," Now let me propose something to you.  If I do decide to acquire your company, I will file the proper papers with the S.E.C.  If that was to happen, I would suggest that you and the Board cooperate with me, rather than try to fight it.  You couldn't stop me, you could only lower my profit margin.  If you don't fight me, you'll find I can be a valuable friend.",1,male,True
655,EDWARD, It's not your company.  It's a public company.  We both know that you can only keep it going for a couple more years before you get swallowed up by debt.,1,male,True
656,EDWARD, Yes?,1,male,True
657,EDWARD, Now it's my turn to apologize.  I'm afraid that I have a private call that I must deal with.  If I may be excused…,1,male,True
658,EDWARD, My apologies again.,1,male,True
659,EDWARD, At least stay for dinner.,1,male,True
660,EDWARD, Which is?,1,male,True
661,EDWARD," If you feel that way, do what you have to do.  But if you change your mind, come to me.  My door will be open.",1,male,True
662,EDWARD, You and your fork.  You were such a picture.,1,male,True
663,EDWARD," Yes.  Yes, but just for two.",1,male,True
664,EDWARD, Of course.,1,male,True
665,EDWARD, That's Cindy.,1,male,True
666,EDWARD," She's very little.  Just over five feet.  But she's got the best body. It's perfect, and her face… you can see.",1,male,True
667,EDWARD," Dumber than a doornail, though.  I guess they beat the intelligence out of you in finishing school.",1,male,True
668,EDWARD, Cindy?  No.  That's over.  She was too much trouble.  I don't have time to play games with women.,1,male,True
669,EDWARD," We were right, they don't have any cash.  The only card he had was the Navy contract and we know what happened to that.",1,male,True
670,EDWARD," Well, that's your job.",1,male,True
671,EDWARD, Do some research.  The guy used to be a millionaire.  Where's he get his money these days?  What banks are loaning it to him?  Find out.  We have lots of friends.  It wouldn't take much.  A couple phone calls.,1,male,True
672,EDWARD, Are those real?,1,male,True
673,EDWARD, They look lovely.,1,male,True
674,EDWARD, Now you're thinking.  Get on it.  We're going to wrap this up by Friday.  I know it now.  Talk to you tomorrow.,1,male,True
675,EDWARD," Have I ever told you how very, very beautiful you are?  You are, you know. Very beautiful.",1,male,True
676,EDWARD, I certainly could have done a lot worse for a wrong turn on Hollywood Boulevard.,1,male,True
677,EDWARD," Easy, doll.  You're supposed to sip it.",1,male,True
678,EDWARD, Makes what easier?,1,male,True
679,EDWARD, I don't think you need anymore.  You're already drunk.,1,male,True
680,EDWARD, What's wrong with you?  You've been acting strange all evening.  Are you mad at me?,1,male,True
681,EDWARD," Fine, then come here and get it over with.",1,male,True
682,EDWARD, What is this?  What's the matter with you?  Last night you weren't complaining.  You weren't trying to rush through it.  Last night you seemed to like it.,1,male,True
683,EDWARD, You didn't feel anything?  Nothing? You don't ever enjoy making love?,1,male,True
684,EDWARD, Why not?  I think I've been pretty good to you the last few days.  Haven't I treated you well?,1,male,True
685,EDWARD, Then what is it?  Am I ugly to you?  Am I fat and disgusting?  Do I smell bad? People have been so bold as to tell me I'm somewhat attractive.  Aren't I to you?,1,male,True
686,EDWARD, Then why are you in such a rush to get it over with?  Why do you have to get drunk?  Is it really that horrible? I'm not asking you to love me.  I'm not even asking you to like me.,1,male,True
687,EDWARD," Fine.  Don't like me.  But don't lie to me.  Maybe you hate me now for some reason that I can't fathom, but you enjoyed it last night as much as I did.",1,male,True
688,EDWARD, Tell me the truth!,1,male,True
689,EDWARD, You're lieing!,1,male,True
690,EDWARD, Too late.,1,male,True
691,EDWARD, You didn't enjoy that?,1,male,True
692,EDWARD, Alright.  Then just do your job.,1,male,True
693,EDWARD, What are you doing?,1,male,True
694,EDWARD, Why do you always have to take a shower after we make love?,1,male,True
695,EDWARD, What are you doing?,1,male,True
696,EDWARD," Why don't you sit on the couch, or go back to bed?  Don't you feel alright?",1,male,True
697,EDWARD," No wonder, the way you were drinking last night. You were great though.  You're an incredible lover.",1,male,True
698,EDWARD, I hope you feel better.  I'll be gone all day.  Maybe we'll have dinner someplace nice tonight.,1,male,True
699,EDWARD, Flight of fancy.  Let's offer eight.  That should bring them back down to earth.  Then we'll raise it to nine and close the deal.,1,male,True
700,EDWARD, Yes.  Time to jump out of the closet.,1,male,True
701,EDWARD, Black.,1,male,True
702,EDWARD," So, tell me about Kross.",1,male,True

704,EDWARD, Need me to call anyone?,1,male,True
705,EDWARD, I will.,1,male,True

707,EDWARD, She's incredible.  In every way.,1,male,True
708,EDWARD," Tell Bill what you said to me, that first night. It was something like ""if you're looking for romance you were cruising down the wrong street.  But if you want to fuck, you've found the best…"" Was that how it went?",1,male,True
709,EDWARD," What difference does it make where I found her?  I think she's great.  She's a lot smarter and prettier and better in bed than those girls at your friend's agency.  They cost an arm and a leg and they're cold as ice.  But everytime I get into town you try to push another of their girls on me.  Why is that, Bill?  Do you own a piece of that business?",1,male,True
710,EDWARD," What are you thinking about, Bill?",1,male,True
711,EDWARD," You want her, don't you?",1,male,True
712,EDWARD," You're drooling, Bill.",1,male,True
713,EDWARD, She's the best.  But you'll have to wear a condom.  She's careful about that.,1,male,True
714,EDWARD, North American Steel.,1,male,True
715,EDWARD, Why not?,1,male,True
716,EDWARD," My, you're quiet.  You haven't said a word to me since we left the restaurant.  I kind of like it, but…",1,male,True
717,EDWARD, Have you lost your mind?!,1,male,True
718,EDWARD, Would you please tell me what you're mad about?,1,male,True
719,EDWARD, Alright.  Just calm down.,1,male,True
720,EDWARD, I'm sorry.  It was a stupid joke.  I wasn't serious….,1,male,True
721,EDWARD, Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?,1,male,True
722,EDWARD," I… I wasn't serious.  It was just a joke.  I was razzing Bill because he runs this call girl service.  We tease each other like that.  He brings out the worst locker room talk from me. But I didn't think you'd mind my saying… I mean, it's not as if you're from a convent.  You tell me yourself it's just a job to you.",1,male,True
723,EDWARD, Of course.  You're right.  I'm sorry.,1,male,True
724,EDWARD," Vivian, I'm very sorry.  You're absolutely right.  That was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I can tell that you have a lot of pride and I should have known that that would hurt you.",1,male,True
725,EDWARD," Alright.  I've apologized.  I've said I'm sorry.  Now if you want to take what you've earned so far and walk out of here, I'll understand.",1,male,True
726,EDWARD, Do you want me to call a cab?,1,male,True
727,EDWARD, Do you?,1,male,True
728,EDWARD," Then think about it.  I've apologized. I've heard what you have to say. You're right, and it won't happen again.  But if you can't get over this then you should leave, because I'm only going to be here a couple more days and I'm not going to spend it fighting with you.  Understand?",1,male,True
729,EDWARD," Alright.  I'll call a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.",1,male,True
730,EDWARD, I'm sorry.  I really am sorry.,1,male,True
731,EDWARD," I've been a fiendish cad, and I'll make it up to you.",1,male,True
732,EDWARD," Because I was a boor, a clod, an oaf, a cretin, a dunce, a putz, a shmuck…",1,male,True
733,EDWARD, …but I shall make amends as only a Harris can.,1,male,True
734,EDWARD, I shall give you an experience that will last a lifetime.,1,male,True
735,EDWARD, I'm going to take you to the opera.,1,male,True
736,EDWARD, That's it.  That's what you're wearing tonight.,1,male,True
737,EDWARD, She'll wear it out.  I'm taking her to Aïda in San Francisco tonight.,1,male,True
738,EDWARD, Feel like Cinderella yet?,1,male,True
739,EDWARD," Bill, Bill, stop panicking.  I'll read the contracts on the plane.  Just have the brokerage arrange the flight for me.  Kross isn't going anywhere.  I don't need to watch the stock go down today.  Have it ready.  I'll make a couple more stops and be there in an hour or two.  'Bye.",1,male,True
740,EDWARD," My empire may crumble through neglect, but it's worth it.  I've been meaning to see Aïda before it closes and now I have a good excuse.  But you must be freezing in that skimpy thing.",1,male,True
741,EDWARD," No, no.  You're bound to catch pneumonia if we don't do something.",1,male,True
742,EDWARD," Nice, but not what I had in mind.  I'm looking for something really special.",1,male,True
743,EDWARD," Vivian, trust me, I know furs.  I'm going to find you one that will give you multiple orgasms.",1,male,True
744,EDWARD, Yes.,1,male,True
745,EDWARD, I'm glad you're having fun.  Now be quiet while I read these.,1,male,True
746,EDWARD, Go away.,1,male,True
747,EDWARD, What are you doing?,1,male,True
748,EDWARD, You'd better put on your clothes.,1,male,True
749,EDWARD, You sure make it hard to concentrate on my work.,1,male,True
750,EDWARD," Some people say that opera is an acquired taste —— that's why everyone prefers movies —— but I don't believe it.  It's something you're born to.  But I don't mean that in an elitist sense.  Highborn, lowborn, you can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  Some love it, some hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might force themselves to appreciate it, but they'll never love it.  Maybe there's an opera gene in a person's DNA.",1,male,True
751,EDWARD, So am I.,1,male,True
752,EDWARD, I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story for you.  But you'll be surprised at how much you'll understand by the way they sing.  The music conveys their emotions more powerfully than any words.,1,male,True
753,EDWARD," Radames is desperately in love with Aïda, a mere slave.  Yet he is forced to marry Amneris, the King's daughter.",1,male,True
754,EDWARD, Here he tells Aïda how much loves her but…,1,male,True
755,EDWARD, Are you alright.  Can you make it down the stairs?,1,male,True
756,EDWARD," You liked the opera, didn't you?",1,male,True
757,EDWARD," Yes, two more nights.",1,male,True
758,EDWARD, No… I have to get back to New York. I've got appointments waiting for me.,1,male,True
759,EDWARD, It was a pleasure.  You're welcome.,1,male,True
760,EDWARD, What's the matter?,1,male,True
761,EDWARD, Oh.,1,male,True
762,EDWARD, I'm sorry if it's hard on you.,1,male,True
763,EDWARD, Sure.  Let me call ——,1,male,True
764,EDWARD, Okay.  Order anything you want.,1,male,True
765,EDWARD, You're such an operator.,1,male,True

769,EDWARD, Mr. Kross.,1,male,True
770,EDWARD, Have a seat.,1,male,True
771,EDWARD, Excellent.  I'm sure that will be the best for everyone.,1,male,True
772,EDWARD, There is nothing to apologize for. It's just business.,1,male,True
773,EDWARD, I appreciate that.  And I'm sure things will go well for you.,1,male,True
774,EDWARD, Perhaps you could do me one favor though.  If you could take an hour to accompany me down to my brokerage and have a brief talk with my lawyer.  Just answer a couple questions.,1,male,True
775,EDWARD," Let me be completely up front with you, Mr. Kross.  We're preparing our bid now.  That bid is based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The more we know the higher our bid can be.  That might affect the deal we have for your shares…",1,male,True
776,EDWARD, It doesn't have to be that way.,1,male,True
777,EDWARD, Good.  Vivian ——,1,male,True
778,EDWARD, Excuse me for one second.,1,male,True
779,EDWARD, I'm going to be gone all day.  I don't think I'll be back in time for dinner so go ahead and eat.  Alright?,1,male,True
780,EDWARD, Why'd you run off?,1,male,True
781,EDWARD, I… I didn't do anything to him.,1,male,True
782,EDWARD, He just realised that it would be smart to let me buy him out before his company went under.  Noboby put a gun to his head.,1,male,True
783,EDWARD," Wrong?  Vivian, this is a very complex transaction.  There's no right and wrong here.  You don't know anything about this kind of business.",1,male,True
784,EDWARD, What?  You think Kross is some kind of martyr?  We didn't threatten him; we bought him.  He's selling out everyone at his company to get an extra dollar a share.,1,male,True
785,EDWARD, I'm getting a lecture on ethics from a prostitute.,1,male,True
786,EDWARD," I don't have time for this.  If you don't like it, you're free to go.  No one's holding you prisoner.",1,male,True
787,EDWARD, Everything's fine.  Let's go.,1,male,True
788,EDWARD, Hmm?,1,male,True
789,EDWARD, I don't know.,1,male,True
790,EDWARD, I just thought I'd look at the shipyards again.  Before I go back to New York.,1,male,True
791,EDWARD, Would you like to come with me?,1,male,True
792,EDWARD, You can always Fedex it later.,1,male,True
793,EDWARD," Yes, a few things.  Not all what we wanted to hear, but…",1,male,True
794,EDWARD, But… it's not important.  Let's head back.,1,male,True
795,EDWARD, Cut it out!  What's going on?!,1,male,True
796,EDWARD, What the hell are you doing?,1,male,True
797,EDWARD, Why were you hitting her?,1,male,True

816,EDWARD, Wait!  Wait a second.  Let's talk about this.,1,male,True
817,EDWARD, What about your clothes?  And the mink. That's a ten thousand dollar mink.,1,male,True
818,EDWARD, Hold on a second.  Let's think this thing through.,1,male,True
819,EDWARD, Then take the money.,1,male,True
820,EDWARD, What is this?  What was last night all about?  Do you really want to go?,1,male,True
821,EDWARD, What do you want from me?  You want me to tell you I'll change?  You want me to give up millions of dollars of business?  You want me say I'll marry you?,1,male,True
822,EDWARD, Is everything taken care of?,1,male,True
823,EDWARD, It's been wonderful.,1,male,True
824,EDWARD, Good.,1,male,True
825,EDWARD, Umm… pardon me.  I'm looking for someone.  She's a blond woman.  Pretty. Mouthy.  Kind of difficult…,1,male,True
826,EDWARD," Yes, I think I'm lost again.",1,male,True
831,EDWARD, Come in!  It's open.,1,male,True
832,EDWARD, Mostly.  Sometimes the companies would pay me not to buy them.,1,male,True
833,EDWARD," Vivian, I'm glad you're there.  Is everything alright?",1,male,True
834,EDWARD," I'll be happy to look into it for you. To be honest, I don't know if we've bought any of your stock.",1,male,True
835,EDWARD, Vivian?,1,male,True
940,JAKE," It's a pleasure, Mr. Harris.",1,male,True
941,JAKE, This is the jewel in Kross' crown.  Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  We can strip out all the heavy equipment.  Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas.  World War II stuff that nobody builds anymore because it costs too much.  The Japanese are salivating for them.,1,male,True
942,JAKE," Waste processing plant.  They don't use it anymore.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  The real estate possibilities are endless.  In fact, I talked to a couple of developers —— under the table, of course —— and they said we could…",1,male,True
943,JAKE, I talked to some developers about the land.,1,male,True
944,JAKE," I'm sorry, sir.  They're close friends; they'd never breathe a word…",1,male,True

1046,KROSS, I'm sorry.  That was out of line.,1,male,True
1047,KROSS," Miss, I'm sorry about that remark.  I apologize.  It was uncalled for.",1,male,True
1048,KROSS," I'm sorry.  I'll get to the point.  I think you're trying to take over my company. Given your track record, if you get it it's easy to guess you'll liquidate it. I don't want that to happen.  I built this company up myself.  I've run it for forty years.  We're in bad shape right now, but we're going to get through it…",1,male,True
1049,KROSS, What would it cost to buy out your stock?  Name your price.,1,male,True
1050,KROSS," Not… right now.  But we're going to get a large contract to build four destroyers for the Navy.  They're a revolutionary design and, once we can prove it, I know we'll get more orders. I could give you a promissory note.",1,male,True

1056,KROSS," There was a time when men got rich by building things.  I built ships the size of cities!  Ships that could rule the seas into the next century.  Why, last year the Navy recommissioned a ship out of mothballs that I built forty years ago.  They did it because they knew damn well no one could build anything better!  We built this country into the greatest industrial power the world has ever known.  We creamed the Japanese!  We dwarfed the rest of the world.  Dwarfed! This country sent men to the moon! But something happened…",1,male,True
1057,KROSS," We made mistakes, maybe.  I don't know. Listened to too many Harvard fags telling us how to maximize profits.  And now men like your boyfriend, they make themselves rich by sucking the money out of our shipyards. They're destroying everything we built.",1,male,True
1058,KROSS," Hell, I was no saint.  I screwed people too.  But for every guy I stepped on, I gave a hundred a good job.  Men like Harris are different.  They don't give, they just take.  But stay with him, little girl.  He's going to be a good little meal ticket for you.",1,male,True
1059,KROSS, Forget it.  I have to go anyway.,1,male,True
1060,KROSS, No.  Thank you for this talk.  You've cleared my head.  I know what to do now.,1,male,True
1061,KROSS, I'm not going to pay you off.  I'm going to fight you with every resource I have.  Neither you nor any of your cronies will ever set foot in my shipyards.  You'll burn in hell first.,1,male,True
1062,KROSS, I'm never going to speak to you.  I'm never going to see your face again. I'm just going to stop you.  Got that?,1,male,True
1063,KROSS, Mr. Harris.,1,male,True
1064,KROSS, I can't stay very long.,1,male,True
1065,KROSS, Young lady.,1,male,True
1066,KROSS," I'll get to the point.  As I said earlier today to your lawyer, I've reconsidered my position on your expected acquisition offer. After the filing period is over, I'll recommend to the board that we accept your bid.",1,male,True
1067,KROSS, And the other night… I want to apologize for…,1,male,True
1068,KROSS, Yes.  Business.,1,male,True
1069,KROSS, That's all.  I just wanted to tell you my decision in person.,1,male,True
1070,KROSS, Thank you.  I'd better be going.,1,male,True
1071,KROSS, I don't think that's quite proper at this time.  Maybe after the filing period.,1,male,True
1072,KROSS," And if I throw myself on my sword, and you promise to take care of my family.",1,male,True
1073,KROSS, Alright.  I'll answer your questions. Whatever you want.,1,male,True
1082,LIMO DRIVER," Are you sure this is the right place, ma'am?",1,male,True
1083,LIMO DRIVER, Maybe I should go with you.  This doesn't look like a good place for a lady to be alone.,1,male,True
1084,LIMO DRIVER," You sure, ma'am?",1,male,True
1085,LIMO DRIVER, I was getting worried.,1,male,True
1030,MAID, Would you like me to turn down your bed?,1,female,True
1031,MAID, Would you like me to turn down your bedspread?,1,female,True
1032,MAID," No, not really.  It's just a service of the hotel.",1,female,True
1033,MAID, Yes.,1,female,True
1034,MAID, It's not laziness exactly.  Is just a courtesy.,1,female,True
1035,MAID," Yeah, it always seemed stupid to me too.",1,female,True
864,MR. THOMAS," May I help you, Miss?",1,male,True

869,MR. THOMAS, Mr. Harris?,1,male,True
870,MR. THOMAS, Are you alright?,1,male,True
871,MR. THOMAS, Why don't you come with me?  We'll chat for a moment.,1,male,True
872,MR. THOMAS," My dear, I want you to understand that there are certain things that don't happen in the Beverly Wilshire.  Things that go on in other hotels.  You understand?",1,male,True
873,MR. THOMAS," But Mr. Harris is a very special customer of this hotel.  And we like to think of our special customers as friends.  As a customer, I would expect Mr. Harris to sign in any additional guests that he wants to spend the night.  But as a friend, we're willing to overlook it.  I'm assuming you're a relative.  You must be his niece.",1,male,True
874,MR. THOMAS," Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.  Correct?",1,male,True
875,MR. THOMAS, I would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner.,1,male,True
876,MR. THOMAS," Women's clothing. Could I speak to Bridget? Bridget, hello.  This is Mr. Thomas at the Beverly Wilshire.  Well, that's flattering. Listen, I'm going to send someone to you. She's the distant niece of a special customer of our's.  A very special customer: Mr. Harris.  Yes, the Long Island Harrises.  His niece is… from out of town. You know.  And she needs a little help dressing.  Maybe you could help?  Thank you very much.  She'll be right over.",1,male,True
877,MR. THOMAS," There you are.  If you have any other problems, come ask for me personally. I'm Mr. Thomas.",1,male,True
878,MR. THOMAS," Good evening, Mr. Harris.",1,male,True
879,MR. THOMAS," I met your… ""niece"" in the lobby today.",1,male,True
880,MR. THOMAS, That pretty young girl staying in your room.  I just assumed…,1,male,True
881,MR. THOMAS," Ah, my mistake.",1,male,True
882,MR. THOMAS," No, sir.  Good evening.",1,male,True
883,MR. THOMAS, Fine.  Hello.,1,male,True
884,MR. THOMAS, It's very pretty.  The color is very becoming on you.,1,male,True
885,MR. THOMAS," Stunning.  But Miss Vivian, it really isn't necessary for me to approve every outfit you wear.",1,male,True
886,MR. THOMAS, It's a very nice restaurant.,1,male,True
887,MR. THOMAS, You look fine.  Mind what fork you use.,1,male,True
888,MR. THOMAS, Miss Vivian.,1,male,True

891,MR. THOMAS," Well, I'm on duty right now.  Just use the one on the left.",1,male,True
892,MR. THOMAS, I…?  How am I responsible?,1,male,True
893,MR. THOMAS," Alright, come with me, young lady.  In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen.",1,male,True
894,MR. THOMAS, And as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.,1,male,True
895,MR. THOMAS, You had good parents.,1,male,True
896,MR. THOMAS," Well, he was either European or badly brought up.",1,male,True
897,MR. THOMAS," That doesn't mean a thing.  Some of the richest people I've met have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.",1,male,True
898,MR. THOMAS," That means he has inherited his money down a long family line.  It used to be fashionable to look down upon people who became rich through their own labor. In fact, it seems to be in fashion again. But let's continue with our lesson.  Most restaurants don't even lay out their silver correctly, so if they don't, it isn't your fault if you pick up the wrong utensil. Spoons…",1,male,True
899,MR. THOMAS, Miss Vivian.,1,male,True
900,MR. THOMAS, Where are you going?,1,male,True
901,MR. THOMAS," But you're coming back, aren't you?",1,male,True
902,MR. THOMAS, Then why don't you use one of the hotel's limousines?,1,male,True
903,MR. THOMAS, Of course.  A small perk for the guests in our better rooms.,1,male,True
904,MR. THOMAS, Discretion is our middle name here at the Beverly Wilshire.,1,male,True
905,MR. THOMAS," Miss Vivian, how are you?  I understand Mr. Harris is checking out today.  Will you be accompanying him to New York?",1,male,True
906,MR. THOMAS, Oh.,1,male,True
907,MR. THOMAS, Where did you get that bruise?,1,male,True
908,MR. THOMAS, Of course.,1,male,True
909,MR. THOMAS, Is there anything else?  Anything I can do to help you?  Would you like the limo to take you anywhere?,1,male,True
910,MR. THOMAS," Goodbye, Miss Vivian.  You're always welcome back.",1,male,True
911,MR. THOMAS, Mr. Harris.  I trust your stay has been enjoyable?,1,male,True
912,MR. THOMAS," Miss Vivian, left something for me to give to you.  Here.",1,male,True

848,OPERATOR, Yes?,1,male,True
849,OPERATOR," Ah, yes.  I should have known.",1,male,True
850,OPERATOR," Floor, ma'am?",1,male,True
851,OPERATOR," Ma'am, I wanted to appologise to you for the way I behaved.  It won't happen again.",1,male,True
852,OPERATOR, I'm sorry about what I said.,1,male,True
1078,PILOT, Mr. Harris?,1,male,True
1079,PILOT," Your plane is ready to go, sir.",1,male,True
1076,SALESMAN, I have just the thing.,1,male,True
1077,SALESMAN, Perhaps this is more what you had in mind…,1,male,True
853,SALESWOMAN, May I help you?,1,female,True
854,SALESWOMAN, Are you looking for something in particular?,1,female,True
855,SALESWOMAN, Yes.,1,female,True

859,SALESWOMAN, It's very pretty.  Would you like to try it on?,1,female,True
860,SALESWOMAN, Isn't it pretty?  It's on sale.,1,female,True
861,SALESWOMAN," Oh, you're so lucky.  It's supposed to be fabulous.",1,female,True
862,SALEWOMAN, I don't think it would fit you.,1,female,True
863,SALEWOMAN, Pardon?,1,female,True
1074,SECRETARY," How do you like it, Mr. Reaves?",1,female,True
1075,SECRETARY, Cream or sugar?,1,female,True
926,THANE, And I'm looking for Vivian.  Bridget told me all about you.,1,male,True
927,THANE," Good things.  Only good things. Nebraska, right?",1,male,True
928,THANE," Well, we'll give you the princess treatment, this way.",1,male,True
929,THANE," Vivian, this is Yule, he'll be doing your nails.  He's very gentle.  At least he is with nails.  I don't know about anything else.",1,male,True
930,THANE, We have a lot of work to do.  Are you with me?,1,male,True
931,THANE," This should be the right shade for the new you.  These are samples.  You'll have to go down to cosmetics and buy them.  I'll make you a list. No, no, no.  Dear, upward strokes. Always apply the blush with upward strokes, lifting the skin like so.",1,male,True
932,THANE, See? Very simple.  Now you try it.,1,male,True
933,VANCE, We can't buy any more stock without filing.,1,male,True
934,VANCE, Are you sure that's wise? I could hide some blocks under another name for a few weeks.,1,male,True
935,VANCE," Mr. Harris, this is Jake Conway.  He's our top researcher.  He'll be giving us the tour.",1,male,True
936,VANCE," He's absolutely right, Jake.  That was an incredibly stupid thing to do.",1,male,True

1,VIVIAN, We should be working.  The rent's over due.,1,female,True
2,VIVIAN, A hundred and twenty.,1,female,True
3,VIVIAN, We shouldn't let the rent go over every month.  One of these days he's going to kick us out of our place.,1,female,True
4,VIVIAN, Why don't we work a little longer? Save up for next month.,1,female,True
5,VIVIAN, What was that?,1,female,True
6,VIVIAN," Yeah, it's getting cold out.",1,female,True
7,VIVIAN, How much?,1,female,True
8,VIVIAN, Sixty?  We still have enough for the rent?,1,female,True
9,VIVIAN, What if he hears us coming in?  He's gonna be pissed.,1,female,True

95,VIVIAN, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go.,1,female,True
96,VIVIAN," Hey, I'll be looking forward to spending my money when you're gone.",1,female,True

162,VIVIAN, I guess that's so you won't have any competition.,1,female,True
163,VIVIAN, Who is it?,1,female,True
164,VIVIAN, What?,1,female,True
165,VIVIAN, I don't know.  Is there some kind of trick to it?,1,female,True
166,VIVIAN," Well, maybe you'd better do it.  I don't know if he likes that kind of thing or not.  I'll watch to see how it's done.",1,female,True
167,VIVIAN, That's it?  That's all?  You just fold it over.,1,female,True
168,VIVIAN, You mean there are people who are too lazy to do that on their own?,1,female,True
169,VIVIAN," Yeah, you could chew people's food for them too. I mean, I'm not blaming you, I'm sure it isn't your idea, but I can't believe anybody expects someone to fold down their bedspread every night.  Vacuum floors, do dishes, okay, but that?",1,female,True
170,VIVIAN, Do you like it?,1,female,True
171,VIVIAN, Well?,1,female,True
172,VIVIAN, You hate it.,1,female,True
173,VIVIAN," Yeah, I don't look like a whore anymore.  I thought that's what you wanted.",1,female,True
174,VIVIAN," Yeah, it cost some.  But I'll pay you back out of my money…",1,female,True
175,VIVIAN, Really?,1,female,True
176,VIVIAN," You wanted something more sexy, huh? Tight, low cut.  Guy's like that.",1,female,True
177,VIVIAN, Taste isn't hard when you have money to spend.  The woman at Saks told me what to wear and the fag cut my hair and told me how to do my makeup.  But I hoped you'd like it.,1,female,True
178,VIVIAN," Here, let me help you.",1,female,True
179,VIVIAN, Oh.,1,female,True
180,VIVIAN," Well, Mr. Thomas wasn't mean to me, exactly.  Most everyone has been nice, least since I dressed up.  Funny how different people treat you.  Except the elevator boy.  He's a snot.",1,female,True
181,VIVIAN, Fired?  Well… … not fired.  Maybe yelled at.,1,female,True
182,VIVIAN," Yes, I saved all the receipts.  I bought three dresses and some other stuff.",1,female,True
183,VIVIAN," I didn't figure I'd be going out much. And clothes are so expensive around here. Two of them were on sale, but even then it all came to eight hundred and fifty seven dollars.  I could have done better at Sears or something but…",1,female,True
184,VIVIAN," Yeah… Here, let me show you what I bought.",1,female,True
185,VIVIAN," Yeah, like it?",1,female,True
186,VIVIAN," Good, I got another one that matches this dress.",1,female,True
187,VIVIAN," And I got a white one too, for my yellow dress.  I couldn't find a yellow one.  I kinda thought they were sexy. But classy too…",1,female,True
188,VIVIAN, I'll get it.,1,female,True
189,VIVIAN, Come on in.  Put it down there.,1,female,True
190,VIVIAN, I'm starting to like champagne.  Now I'll show you the good stuff.,1,female,True
191,VIVIAN," Well, I figured you weren't going to be taking me out a lot, so I figured what I really needed was some sexy lingerie for when I was in.",1,female,True
192,VIVIAN, Why don't you relax while I show you?,1,female,True
193,VIVIAN, Did I do good?,1,female,True
194,VIVIAN," I got most of it at this great sale.  A lot of it's polyester, but that white one is real silk.",1,female,True
195,VIVIAN, It only cost around two thirty—five.,1,female,True
196,VIVIAN, Are you going to let me keep it all?,1,female,True
197,VIVIAN," So what do you think now?  With a new do, some clean clothes, the stink washed off me.  Do I rate as good as your high class call girls?",1,female,True
198,VIVIAN, You want to screw?,1,female,True
199,VIVIAN, What do you do all day while you're gone?,1,female,True
200,VIVIAN, What's it for?,1,female,True
201,VIVIAN, What kind of company?,1,female,True
202,VIVIAN, Why would you want it?,1,female,True
203,VIVIAN, Yeah.  I'm curious about everything. Kate says it's gonna kill me someday.,1,female,True
204,VIVIAN, Yes.,1,female,True
205,VIVIAN," If it's worth that much money, why doesn't somebody else try to buy it?",1,female,True
206,VIVIAN, Oh.,1,female,True
207,VIVIAN, So you can make all that money just by buying it and then selling everything?,1,female,True
208,VIVIAN, What a racket!  It sounds so easy.,1,female,True
209,VIVIAN, So that's how you got rich?  Buying companies?,1,female,True
210,VIVIAN," But now that you're rich, why do you keep doing it?",1,female,True
211,VIVIAN, Okay.,1,female,True
212,VIVIAN, Like a suit.,1,female,True
213,VIVIAN, How about hamburgers?  Do you have any hamburgers?  Great.  And fries.  And ketchup.  Yeah.  I'm in the penthouse. The penthouse on the top floor.  Right.,1,female,True
214,VIVIAN, Hi.  How are you?,1,female,True

216,VIVIAN, Thanks.  See ya.,1,female,True
217,VIVIAN, How the am I going to last a week?,1,female,True
218,VIVIAN, What are you doing here?,1,female,True
219,VIVIAN," Kate, you'd better go.  He's not going to like it if you're here.",1,female,True
220,VIVIAN, Of course we're friends.  I just don't want him to get mad if he finds you here.  Besides the Hotel people are keeping an eye on me.,1,female,True
221,VIVIAN, We'd better not.  He might come back any time.,1,female,True
222,VIVIAN, I'll just fluff it up with some spray.,1,female,True
223,VIVIAN," Hey, I know.  Why are you acting like this?",1,female,True
224,VIVIAN, I wouldn't do that.,1,female,True
225,VIVIAN, Listen… you have any smoke?  It's been a couple days and I'm dieing for some.,1,female,True
226,VIVIAN," No, I promised him I wouldn't leave.",1,female,True
227,VIVIAN," No, I better not.  He might call or something.  I don't want to blow this. It's too much money.  I can last.",1,female,True
228,VIVIAN, Nice.  He's okay.  I mean he doesn't hit me or anything.,1,female,True
229,VIVIAN," I miss you do. Hey, you want to see what else he got me?  I got some great stuff.  Come on.",1,female,True
230,VIVIAN, And that one is real silk.,1,female,True
231,VIVIAN, I picked it out.  But he paid for it. He said I could keep it.,1,female,True
232,VIVIAN, I don't know.  He likes to screw me.,1,female,True
233,VIVIAN," No, he lives in New York.",1,female,True
234,VIVIAN, I don't think he's going to do it. He's just… he doesn't like me that much.,1,female,True
235,VIVIAN," Listen, why don't we could order some food from Room Service.  What the hell?",1,female,True
236,VIVIAN, I'm coming back.,1,female,True
237,VIVIAN," Yeah, sure.  I got some.  I'll give you some.",1,female,True
238,VIVIAN," Here, take it all.  I don't need it. I'll have more when I get back.  A lot more.  We'll take it easy for awhile.",1,female,True
239,VIVIAN, Hello?,1,female,True
240,VIVIAN, Fine.  Fine.  Just bored.  It's been real quiet.,1,female,True
241,VIVIAN, 'Bye.,1,female,True
242,VIVIAN, He's not really my uncle.,1,female,True
243,VIVIAN, How do I look?,1,female,True
244,VIVIAN, I'm just shaking 'cause Edward is taking me to this really fancy place. The Rex?  Is that a nice place?,1,female,True
245,VIVIAN, Oh sorry.,1,female,True

253,VIVIAN, Can I get some cigarettes?  I'm dieing for a smoke.,1,female,True
254,VIVIAN, Virginia Slim Lights.,1,female,True
255,VIVIAN, She's… beautiful.,1,female,True
256,VIVIAN, I guess you'll be glad to see her again.,1,female,True
257,VIVIAN, I want to get drunk quickly.  It makes it easier.,1,female,True
258,VIVIAN, My job.  Isn't that what you want now? For me to do my job?,1,female,True
259,VIVIAN," I used to smoke rock so I wouldn't think about my work.  But since you won't let me do that I have to find something else.  This isn't quite as good, but it helps.",1,female,True
260,VIVIAN," I'm not mad at you.  I don't feel anything about you.  It's just that you don't have to give me romantic looks and tell me I'm beautiful.  I don't want to play games with men, I just want to do my job and get it over with.",1,female,True
261,VIVIAN, I was drunk.,1,female,True
262,VIVIAN, Not with customers.  Not with you.,1,female,True
263,VIVIAN, You've been very generous.,1,female,True

266,VIVIAN," Sure, whatever you say.",1,female,True
267,VIVIAN, I don't enjoy it.,1,female,True
268,VIVIAN, Not on the mouth.,1,female,True
269,VIVIAN, No.  It's just a job.,1,female,True
270,VIVIAN, Taking a shower.,1,female,True
271,VIVIAN, To get clean.,1,female,True
272,VIVIAN, Just sitt'n.,1,female,True
273,VIVIAN, I've got a headache.,1,female,True

279,VIVIAN, Well then show me.  Edward might take me to dinner tonight and I don't want to look like a dummy in front of him.,1,female,True
280,VIVIAN," No, you got to show me the whole thing. The whole dinner thing.  From the top. You got me in this mess.",1,female,True

292,VIVIAN, I almost picked up that fucking table and smashed it in your fucking face.  I almost did it!,1,female,True
293,VIVIAN, I want the money that you owe me and I'm getting out of here!,1,female,True
294,VIVIAN," I've been with stinking old men that made me want to puke, but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you do!  You make me feel dirty inside.",1,female,True
295,VIVIAN, YOU DON'T OWN ME!  I say when!  I say who!  I say how much!  If I make a deal with you it's between me and you and if he wants to FUCK ME TOO then he can ask me and I'll tell him how much!,1,female,True
296,VIVIAN, I don't screw everyone who pulls down their pants.  I say who!  I say how much!  I run my life!  You don't run my life!,1,female,True
297,VIVIAN, It didn't hurt me!  It doesn't hurt you when someone pisses on you!  It just pisses you off!,1,female,True

302,VIVIAN," Yeah, right.  What?",1,female,True
303,VIVIAN, Are you sure this is alright?  I don't want you to hurt your business.,1,female,True
304,VIVIAN, I'm okay.,1,female,True
305,VIVIAN, It's so soft.,1,female,True
306,VIVIAN, I like this one.,1,female,True
307,VIVIAN, I think I'm coming.,1,female,True
308,VIVIAN, I've never been on a plane before.,1,female,True
309,VIVIAN, Being quiet.,1,female,True
310,VIVIAN, I can see the bridge.  It's all lit up. It's so beautiful.,1,female,True
311,VIVIAN," Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought me.",1,female,True
312,VIVIAN," If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?",1,female,True
313,VIVIAN, I just stood up to fast.  My head is spinning.  The blood all went to my legs.  Just a second.,1,female,True
314,VIVIAN, Yeah.  It was… I liked it so much.  It… was sad.,1,female,True
315,VIVIAN, I'm okay now.,1,female,True
316,VIVIAN," So I guess we've got two nights left, right?",1,female,True
317,VIVIAN, I just wasn't sure if you might have to stay longer.  Because of business or something.,1,female,True
318,VIVIAN, Thank you for taking me tonight.  I'll never forget it.  Never.,1,female,True
319,VIVIAN, Noth'n.  Just can't sleep.,1,female,True
320,VIVIAN, I really feel like smoking.  I'm not used to going without it for so long.,1,female,True
321,VIVIAN, Can I get some champagne?  Or something to eat?  Maybe it'll help me sleep.,1,female,True
322,VIVIAN," No, no.  I can call.  You sleep.  I'm alright.  Really.",1,female,True

324,VIVIAN, What?,1,female,True
325,VIVIAN, Hi.,1,female,True
326,VIVIAN, What did you do to him?,1,female,True
327,VIVIAN, Then why is he afraid of you?  Last time I saw him he was so strong.  Now he's so scared.,1,female,True
328,VIVIAN, It's wrong.  What you did is wrong.,1,female,True
329,VIVIAN, I know enough business to know when someone is getting screwed.,1,female,True
330,VIVIAN," And that makes it okay, because you can buy people?  If he takes your money than you think he's just the same as you?",1,female,True
331,VIVIAN, At least there are some things I won't do for money.,1,female,True
332,VIVIAN," Roomserve, I'd like a bottle of…",1,female,True

363,VIVIAN, No thanks.  I only want to get fucked by one person at a time.,1,female,True
364,VIVIAN, Three months.,1,female,True
365,VIVIAN, Just get out of here. Does Edward want you here?  I don't think he'd like it if you were talking to me like this.,1,female,True
366,VIVIAN, I know!,1,female,True

368,VIVIAN, You fucker!  You fucker!,1,female,True
369,VIVIAN," Why do guys always know how to hit a girl? Wham, right across the cheek.  Nice and high so it feels like your eye is going to explode.  Stepfathers, boyfriends, pimps, cops, even little lawyers in suits and ties. They all hit you the same.  What do they do, take all the boys aside in high school and show them how?",1,female,True
370,VIVIAN, Nobody needs to.  He already did a good enough job.,1,female,True
371,VIVIAN, I'd better go.,1,female,True
372,VIVIAN, No.  I want to go.  I hate it here.,1,female,True
373,VIVIAN," Yeah, nothing's your fault.  He just works for you doesn't he?  You just give him some of your money and you can't be blamed for what he does behind your back.  How many people has he hit while you weren't around to see it? How many?",1,female,True
374,VIVIAN, I'm getting out of here.,1,female,True
375,VIVIAN, I… I don't want it.,1,female,True
376,VIVIAN, I don't want it.,1,female,True
377,VIVIAN, HARD?  What do you know about hard!? Do you know how many guys I'd have to have to make this much money on the street?  They'd fill up this room! And I'd rather have done it that way if I could never have met you.  I wish I'd never met you.,1,female,True
378,VIVIAN, What can I do now?  I can't go back and I can't stay.,1,female,True

380,VIVIAN, Where are you going?,1,female,True
381,VIVIAN, Don't leave me.  Not yet.,1,female,True

387,VIVIAN," Yeah, that's what I thought.  Bye.",1,female,True
388,VIVIAN, Furs are out of fashion in Hollywood. And I don't have any place to wear the rest.  I'd walk home naked but the cops would stop me.,1,female,True

390,VIVIAN, Right!  I almost forgot.,1,female,True
391,VIVIAN, This makes it all worth while.  Three thousand dollars.,1,female,True
392,VIVIAN, What difference does it make what I want?  What are you going to do?  Take pity on me?  Feel sorry for me?  Maybe you could give me an extra little handout before you go?  Maybe when you come into town next time we can do it again?  Or maybe if I asked real nice you'd put me up in a little place like your model friend until you got tired of me like you did her.,1,female,True
393,VIVIAN, But none of that is going to change the fact that you are a slimy jerk who professionally screws people over.  You want me to hang around and laugh and giggle while you gut people over dinner?  No thanks.,1,female,True
394,VIVIAN, I don't want you to say anything.  I'm just leaving.  Thanks for the money.,1,female,True

957,WILLIAM," You never should have helped her get that magazine cover.  Once those airheads get a taste of fame they want nothing else.  But look, while you're in town, Robert's Agency has three new girls in and they're really hot…",1,male,True
958,WILLIAM," A billionaire looking for a bargain.  What, you met a pro in the hotel?",1,male,True
959,WILLIAM, You picked up a street walker?  Are you nuts?  You know what kind of diseases they've got?,1,male,True
960,WILLIAM, But a street walker?  Your ex-wife of three months raped you in court and now you're going to put a street hooker in your hotel room for a week?  She's probably calling Marvin Mitchelson right now.  What if she's got a screw loose and decides to knife you in your sleep?  What if she slits her wrists in your bathroom?  How am I going to protect you when she and the hotel sue you?,1,male,True
961,WILLIAM," Drop it?  I'm your lawyer for godsakes. There's nothing wrong with wanting a girl, but you have to go with a reputable agency.  If you're too fucking cheap I'll have the brokerage pick up the tab.",1,male,True
962,WILLIAM," Carl, we're not taking about funny money.  We're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation.  Pull out your calculator and add it up.  There's no risk here.",1,male,True
963,WILLIAM, No one has ever lost money in one of our deals.,1,male,True
964,WILLIAM," Look, you're the assholes who fucked up!  You're the ones that's getting dragged into court!  You're the ones that got burned backing amateurs with shell companies.  You're trying to make us choke on eighteen so you can lure back the customers you scared off. We're not doing this to make your life easy.  Get on the fucking phones and do your fucking sales jobs!",1,male,True
965,WILLIAM," Wow, that sounds great!  We'll just wait until we've already spent the money and then ask you how much you want for it.",1,male,True
966,WILLIAM, You know he's got his sights set on a three billion takeover of an aerospace company.  You can't dick this guy around.,1,male,True
967,WILLIAM," Hey, it was a great performance--I started to believe it myself--but they're going to call their spy in the mailroom of Draymen Heux and find out it's bullshit.",1,male,True
968,WILLIAM, The Board knows we're after them.  The word came from Kross this morning.  He wants to talk to you alone.,1,male,True
969,WILLIAM, Your intentions.,1,male,True
970,WILLIAM, I don't think you should.,1,male,True
971,WILLIAM, I'll have to be present when you talk.,1,male,True
972,WILLIAM, Not the street walker?  You're not cocky enough to take her out in public are you?  Not with Kross.,1,male,True
973,WILLIAM, What's it say?,1,male,True
974,WILLIAM, I'll work on the papers.,1,male,True
975,WILLIAM," Any way I can get it, angel.",1,male,True
976,WILLIAM, Both.,1,male,True
977,WILLIAM," You're right, as usual.  Completely mortgaged down to his grandson's scholarship funds.  Best of all, he's applying for another loan.",1,male,True
978,WILLIAM, Oh yeah.,1,male,True
979,WILLIAM, Nope.  It's handled.  Nice and quiet. You can forget all about it.,1,male,True
980,WILLIAM," She's really a looker, huh?  Hot stuff?",1,male,True
981,WILLIAM," Alright, but you'll have to apologize for me if I start to drool.",1,male,True
982,WILLIAM, You look very familiar to me.  Haven't I seen you before?,1,male,True
983,WILLIAM, Have you ever worked for a call girl service or in a house?,1,male,True
984,WILLIAM, Just on the street?,1,male,True
985,WILLIAM," Jesus, Edward, you're the only billionaire I know who would go catting around street corners to find a hooker.",1,male,True
986,WILLIAM," No.  It's just a nice agency and I like to keep my clients happy.  But if you can find true love in Hollywood, for a great markdown, that's okay by me.",1,male,True
987,WILLIAM, Nothing.,1,male,True
988,WILLIAM," Jesus, Edward, don't be so tacky.  I can rent my own girls.",1,male,True
989,WILLIAM, I'm not interested.,1,male,True
990,WILLIAM," Thanks, Ed.  That really turns me on. Now can we just drop it?  Don't we have anything else to talk about?",1,male,True
991,WILLIAM, No.  No way.  You'll never get it.  Not a prayer.,1,male,True
992,WILLIAM," No, I didn't put a horse head in his bed.  I barely did anything.  The old coot must be more desperate than either of us thought.  He agree to sell his shares at ten under the table, but he wants to talk to you. Get assurances that you're both on the same side or something.",1,male,True
993,WILLIAM," Anyhow, I said you might see him this morning at your hotel room. What I'd like you to do is butter him up and then drag him here so I can grill him.",1,male,True
994,WILLIAM, The guy's pathetic.  All you have to do is take him by the hand and bring him over.  If we could just get him to tell us the story on the Navy repair commitments it would be worth it.,1,male,True
995,WILLIAM, He'll be there.,1,male,True
996,WILLIAM," Well, that's about it.  Thirty, sixty days.  Six months.  One year.  After that, Kross is just naval history.",1,male,True
997,WILLIAM, The only question in my mind is what are you going to go after next.,1,male,True
998,WILLIAM, What are you going to do next?,1,male,True
999,WILLIAM, Helicopter?  Going to the opera again?,1,male,True
1000,WILLIAM, You're such a sentimental softy.,1,male,True
1001,WILLIAM, No.  I want to finish that chemical bid so you can take it back to New York.,1,male,True
1002,WILLIAM," No, you know me.  I don't like loose ends.",1,male,True
1003,WILLIAM, Hello again.,1,male,True
1004,WILLIAM, I take it Edward isn't back from his little helicopter trip?,1,male,True
1005,WILLIAM, May I come in?,1,male,True
1006,WILLIAM, You like drinking alone?,1,male,True
1007,WILLIAM, Do you mind?,1,male,True
1008,WILLIAM, It's been a long day. You know Edward's leaving tomorrow. Don't you?  Eleven o'clock flight.,1,male,True
1009,WILLIAM, I'm going to leave some papers here for him to take back to New York.,1,male,True
1010,WILLIAM," Great view.  Lord Harris sure knows how to live, doesn't he?",1,male,True
1011,WILLIAM, Just a joke.  Between me and Ed.  This must be quite a change for a hooker off the boulevard.,1,male,True
1012,WILLIAM," You're a very pretty girl, Vivian.  Too pretty for the street.",1,male,True
1013,WILLIAM, What do you make a week?  Five hundred? Even that?,1,male,True
1014,WILLIAM, With the right manager you could make a lot of money.  More than Edward's giving you. Much more than you can make on the street.,1,male,True
1015,WILLIAM, You've got a mean streak in you.  Don't you?  Maybe that's what Edward liked about you.,1,male,True
1016,WILLIAM," There's nothing to get hostile about. I have some friends who run a nice service.  They aren't like the pimps you find on the street.  They don't muscle you.  They just help you.  Sure, they take a cut, but since you're making a lot more money you won't even think about it.",1,male,True
1017,WILLIAM," How long have you been on the street, Vivian?",1,male,True
1018,WILLIAM, I figured something like that.  You act tough but you don't have a clue as to where you're going.  You're still fresh off the bus from the cornfields.  How long do you think your pretty looks are going to last?,1,male,True
1019,WILLIAM, You're just wasting yourself.  A couple years fucking lowlifes and drug pushers and your face will be ruined.,1,male,True
1020,WILLIAM," Edward?  Oh, now I get it.  It's starting to make sense.  You don't think Edward's going to get rid of you, do you?  What do you think?  You think Edward's going to keep you? Don't you know what a cold bastard he is?  He's not going to keep you.",1,male,True
1021,WILLIAM, Then what's your problem?  I'm trying to help you!,1,male,True
1022,WILLIAM," Don't talk to me like that, whore.",1,male,True
1023,WILLIAM, Fine.  Go back to the street.  End up dead in a dumpster.  What do I care?,1,male,True
1024,WILLIAM, That little bitch!,1,male,True
1025,WILLIAM, That's some nasty little chick you found.  I came to drop off some papers and she started pissing me off.,1,male,True
1026,WILLIAM, What are you?  Gentleman of the year? She's just a whore.  What difference does it make?,1,male,True
1027,WILLIAM," Hey, watch it!  Look, I left you some papers…",1,male,True
1028,WILLIAM, What are you doing?  You need those you asshole!  You need me!,1,male,True
1029,WILLIAM, I don't have to put up with this shit! You're going to have to crawl back to get me!,1,male,True
