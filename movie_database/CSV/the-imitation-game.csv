ALAN TURING, Are you paying attention?,male
ALAN TURING," Good. This is going to go very quickly now. If you are not listening carefully, you will miss things. Important things. You’re writing some of this down? That’s good. - someone has given it a pretty thorough once-over.",male
ALAN TURING," I will not pause, I will not repeat myself, and you will not interrupt me. If you ask me a question, I will ignore it. You think that because you’re sitting where you are, and I am sitting where I am, that you are in control of what is about to happen. You’re mistaken. I am in control, because I know things that you do not know.",male
ALAN TURING," What I will need from you now is a commitment. You will listen closely, and you will not judge me.",male
ALAN TURING," When I am finished — when I have told you that I am finished — you are free to think whatever you like. But until then, you will trust that while this story will be hard for you to understand, everything I am saying I am saying for a reason.",male
ALAN TURING," If you cannot commit to this, then please leave the room. That’s right, you’re the one who’s free to go. But if you choose to stay, if you choose to listen, remember this: If things happen that you do not like, you chose to be here.",male
ALAN TURING, What happens from this moment forward is not my responsibility: It’s yours.,male
ALAN TURING, This will go quite fast now. And that is the last time I will repeat myself. Pay attention.,male
ALAN TURING," — I would step back, if I were you.",male
ALAN TURING," Step back, and don’t breathe so much.",male
ALAN TURING, You’re breathing heavily and you’re going to inhale this junk and you’re going to leave your collicky son without a father.,male
ALAN TURING, Sound carries in this house.,male
ALAN TURING, Cyanide. Undiluted. Wouldn’t take more than a thimbleful to kill you.,male
ALAN TURING, Oh. Disappointing.,male
ALAN TURING, I’d hoped for a bit more.,male
ALAN TURING," You lied to your friend here about your son, which is just unseemly. Collick didn’t keep you up all night. Drink did. You’ve bags under your eyes the size of strawberries. Your topcoat reeks of whiskey. You’re short of breath after walking Manchester United had a match yesterday, yes? I could hear the shouting from Simpson’s on my way home.",male
ALAN TURING," Gentlemen, I don’t think you could figure out who broke into my house if he walked up and spat in your face. What I could really use at the moment is not a bobby but a good cleaning lady. So unless one of you has an apron in your car, I’d suggest that you file your reports and leave me alone.",male
ALAN TURING, The girl told me to wait —,male
ALAN TURING, No. She didn’t.,male
ALAN TURING, Was she supposed to?,male
ALAN TURING, Alan Turing.,male
ALAN TURING, Correct.,male
ALAN TURING, You didn’t. It was written on your paper.,male
ALAN TURING," I’m not sure I can evaluate that, Mr...",male
ALAN TURING, 27.,male
ALAN TURING, 24.,male
ALAN TURING, 23.,male
ALAN TURING," Rather depends on how old my peers were when they did comparable work, doesn’t it?",male
ALAN TURING, Newton discovered the binomial theorem at four papers that changed the world at 26. As far as I can tell I’ve barely made par.,male
ALAN TURING, Would you prefer I make a joke?,male
ALAN TURING," It hardly seems fair that that would be a requirement for employment here, Mr...?",male
ALAN TURING," Oh, I don’t, really.",male
ALAN TURING, I’m agnostic about violence.,male
ALAN TURING, Politics is not my area of expertise.,male
ALAN TURING, Mother says that I can be off- putting sometimes. On account of being the best mathematician in the world.,male
ALAN TURING, Oh. Yes.,male
ALAN TURING, No.,male
ALAN TURING, I don’t speak German.,male
ALAN TURING, I don’t. Speak German.,male
ALAN TURING, I’m quite excellent at crossword puzzles.,male
ALAN TURING, The German codes are a puzzle. A game. Just like any other game.,male
ALAN TURING, I’m very good at games. Puzzles. And I think this is the hardest puzzle in the world.,male
ALAN TURING," I’m afraid I can’t make jokes, Commander Denniston.",male
ALAN TURING, Enigma.,male
ALAN TURING, ... That’s what you’re doing here. The top secret program at Bletchley. You’re trying to break the German Enigma machine.,male
ALAN TURING," It’s the greatest encryption device in history, and the Germans use it for all major communications.",male
ALAN TURING, Goody! Let me try and we’ll know for sure.,male
ALAN TURING, It’s beautiful.,male
ALAN TURING," — It’s not that simple, is it? Just having an Enigma machine doesn’t help you decode the messages.",male
ALAN TURING, Five rotors. Six plugboard cables. That’s...,male
ALAN TURING, — Over one hundred and fifty million million million possible settings.,male
ALAN TURING, Are we all to work together then? I prefer to have my own office.,male
ALAN TURING," I don’t have time to explain myself as I go along, and I’m afraid these men will only slow me down.",male
ALAN TURING, I don’t.,male
ALAN TURING," The problem began, of course, with the carrots.",male
ALAN TURING, Carrots are orange. Peas are green. They mustn’t touch.,male
ALAN TURING, Do you know why people like violence? Because it feels good.,male
ALAN TURING," Humans find violence deeply satisfying. But remove the satisfaction, and the act becomes... Hollow.",male
ALAN TURING, I didn’t learn this on my own though. I had help.,male
ALAN TURING, Christopher helped.,male
ALAN TURING, The game was quite a simple one.,male
ALAN TURING," Every single German message. Every surprise attack. Every bombing run. Every imminent U-boat assault. They were all floating through the air, radio signals that any schoolboy with an AM kit could intercept.",male
ALAN TURING, The trick was that they were encrypted.,male
ALAN TURING, One hundred and fifty nine million million million possible Enigma settings. All we had to do was try each one.,male
ALAN TURING," But if we had 10 men checking one setting a minute, for every day and seven days every week, it would take... Well, you tell me. How many days would it take to check each of the settings?",male
ALAN TURING, ... Would you like a hint? It’s not days. It’s years.,male
ALAN TURING," Oh dear, you still haven’t worked it out, have you? Pity you didn’t pay more attention in school. It’s 20 million years.",male
ALAN TURING," To stop a coming attack, we would have to check worth of settings... In",male
ALAN TURING, Yes.,male
ALAN TURING, Yes.,male
ALAN TURING, Yes.,male
ALAN TURING, What is?,male
ALAN TURING, No you didn’t. You told me you were getting lunch.,male
ALAN TURING, Why would you think that?,male
ALAN TURING, When is lunchtime?,male
ALAN TURING, What is?,male
ALAN TURING, I don’t like sandwiches.,male
ALAN TURING, How?,male
ALAN TURING, You have?,male
ALAN TURING," Oh. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. That’s not progress at all, that’s just blind luck. I’m designing a machine that will allow us to break every message, every day, instantly.",male
ALAN TURING, I’m hungry.,male
ALAN TURING," Peter asked if anyone was hungry. I am. May I have some soup, please?",male
ALAN TURING, This is unacceptable.,male
ALAN TURING," Complaint? Hugh Alexander has denied my requisition. Parts and equipment, to build the machine I’ve designed.",male
ALAN TURING," It’s inspired by an old Polish code machine, only infinitely more advanced.",male
ALAN TURING," Fine. My response is, they are all idiots. Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine. I’ll only need about a hundred thousand pounds.",male
ALAN TURING, It’s highly technical. You wouldn’t understand.,male
ALAN TURING, ... Enigma is a machine. A very well-designed machine. Our problem is that we’re trying to beat it with men. What if only a machine can defeat another machine?,male
ALAN TURING, I do not have time for this —,male
ALAN TURING, Who is your commanding officer?,male
ALAN TURING," Mr. Menzies! You’re headed back to London, yes?",male
ALAN TURING, Will you deliver a letter for me?,male
ALAN TURING, — Really? I can give these men orders now?,male
ALAN TURING, Fantastic. Keith and Charles. You’re both fired.,male
ALAN TURING, You’re mediocre linguists and positively poor codebreakers.,male
ALAN TURING, He just said I could.,male
ALAN TURING, We get more staff.,male
ALAN TURING," All sorts, really. A school teacher. An engineer. A handful of students.",male
ALAN TURING," Well, they say they’re good. Now we should probably find out.",male
ALAN TURING," ... You’ll have six minutes to complete the puzzle, at which point—",male
ALAN TURING," May I continue, please?",male
ALAN TURING, May I please get on with this?,male
ALAN TURING, What is going on here?,male
ALAN TURING," — Miss Clarke. I find tardiness unacceptable under any circumstance. Now take a seat, so we may continue.",male
ALAN TURING, Oh for God’s sake — No.,male
ALAN TURING, Miss Clarke. You now have the distinct honor of having wasted more of my time than any other person in this room. Quiet. Gentlemen. And lady. You have six minutes. Begin.,male
ALAN TURING, No. It takes me eight. But this test isn’t about crosswords about how you approach solving an impossible problem. Do you take the whole thing at once? Do you divide it into smaller,male
ALAN TURING, You’ve finished?,male
ALAN TURING,,male
ALAN TURING, We’re going to break an unbreakable Nazi code and win the war.,male
ALAN TURING, Goodnight.,male
ALAN TURING," Careful! Damn it, will you — It’s not a toy.",male
ALAN TURING, ... Where’s Miss Clarke?,male
ALAN TURING, — Well it’s a very important radio factory you see. It’s not really — I mean along the spectrum of radio factories this one is particularly—,male
ALAN TURING, Hello.,male
ALAN TURING, ... Why aren’t you at Bletchley?,male
ALAN TURING, Gather your things and let’s go.,male
ALAN TURING, And why not?,male
ALAN TURING, You earned a double-first in mathematics.,male
ALAN TURING, You belong at Bletchley.,male
ALAN TURING, What in the world does that even —,male
ALAN TURING," ... We have a group of young women who tend to our clerical tasks. Assistants, translators. They live together in town. Would that be a more suitable environment?",male
ALAN TURING, Yes.,male
ALAN TURING," ... Wonderful ladies, they even organize social events at St Martin’s church, down the road. The whole thing is really quite... Decorous.",male
ALAN TURING," You won’t have the proper clearance, so we’ll have to improvise a bit.",male
ALAN TURING," There is only one thing that matters in this entire world, do you understand? Breaking Enigma.",male
ALAN TURING, ... Sometimes it is the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.,male
ALAN TURING, My machine is how we’re going to win.,male
ALAN TURING, Stop.,male
ALAN TURING, No no don’t —,male
ALAN TURING, My machine will work.,male
ALAN TURING, ... It’ll work.,male
ALAN TURING, Sorry.,male
ALAN TURING," These are actual decrypted Enigma messages, direct from Nazi high command.",male
ALAN TURING, It’s the relationship between the encrypted and decrypted messages that interests me. Is there a clue there that we can build into Christopher?,male
ALAN TURING, Oh. He’s my machine.,male
ALAN TURING, Is that a bad name?,male
ALAN TURING, They’re teaching it already?,male
ALAN TURING," Human beings can compute large sums very quickly. Even Hugh can do that. I want Christopher to be... Smarter. To make a calculation, and then to determine what to do next. Like a person does. Think of it: An electrical brain. A digital computer.",male
ALAN TURING, I’ll show you —,male
ALAN TURING, I’m so sorry.,male
ALAN TURING, Right.,male
ALAN TURING, Really?,male
ALAN TURING, Hey! Don’t touch that!,male
ALAN TURING, That’s my desk.,male
ALAN TURING, What are you doing?,male
ALAN TURING, Why?,male
ALAN TURING," ... This is a Beale Cypher. It’s encrypted with a key phrase, from a book or a poem or... Which one of them did this?",male
ALAN TURING, I’m not a double agent.,male
ALAN TURING," I know you don’t like me... But you don’t think I could actually be a spy, do you?",male
ALAN TURING, No.,male
ALAN TURING, I told you not to do that.,male
ALAN TURING, Hello.,male
ALAN TURING, What? No. Of course not.,male
ALAN TURING, I’m not a Soviet spy.,male
ALAN TURING, Hugh. I swear. I’m not a spy.,male
ALAN TURING, What?,male
ALAN TURING, She’s assisting me with some calculations.,male
ALAN TURING, Thank you.,male
ALAN TURING, ... He likes you.,male
ALAN TURING, You got him to like you.,male
ALAN TURING, Why?,male
ALAN TURING, ... How should I get them to like me?,male
ALAN TURING, Apples.,male
ALAN TURING," No, they really are... I... Joan told me it’d be nice to bring you all something.",male
ALAN TURING," ... There are two fellows in the woods. And they run into a bear. The first fellow, he kneels down and starts to pray. But the second one, he begins lacing up his boots. The first one says, what’re you doing? You can’t outrun a bear.” And the second one responds, “I don’t have to. I only have to outrun you.”",male
ALAN TURING, I’ll be with Christopher if anyone needs me.,male
ALAN TURING," No, Sir.",male
ALAN TURING, ... This is actually not an entirely terrible idea.,male
ALAN TURING, That’s my sandwich.,male
ALAN TURING, It should tell us the day’s Enigma settings!!,male
ALAN TURING, No!!!,male
ALAN TURING, I cannot let you in!! I cannot let you interfere!!!,male
ALAN TURING, It does.,male
ALAN TURING, It works... It was just... Still working.,male
ALAN TURING, You will never understand the importance of what I’ve created here.,male
ALAN TURING, ... Thank you.,male
ALAN TURING, Christopher is simply not moving fast enough.,male
ALAN TURING, Even with the diagonal board he’s not eliminating settings as quickly as —,male
ALAN TURING, You just walked in.,male
ALAN TURING, What?,male
ALAN TURING, That’s ridiculous.,male
ALAN TURING, You cannot leave. I won’t let you.,male
ALAN TURING, I don’t care what’s normal.,male
ALAN TURING, No. This is unacceptable. You are not leaving and that is that.,male
ALAN TURING, You have the opportunity here to make some actual use of your life —,male
ALAN TURING, I want you to stay because I like you.,male
ALAN TURING, I like talking to you.,male
ALAN TURING, What if you weren’t living alone... If you had a husband?,male
ALAN TURING, I do.,male
ALAN TURING, I wasn’t referring to Hugh.,male
ALAN TURING, This makes sense.,male
ALAN TURING, It’s the logical thing to do.,male
ALAN TURING, This is your parents.,male
ALAN TURING," Joan Ca... Wait, is your middle name Caroline or Catherine?",male
ALAN TURING," Joan Elizabeth Clarke, will you marry me?",male
ALAN TURING, ... What if I don’t fancy... being with Joan in that way?,male
ALAN TURING, Should I tell Joan? I’ve had affairs. With other men.,male
ALAN TURING," Having children, a family... I want that with her. I do. I just don’t know if I can... Pretend...",male
ALAN TURING, ... I know.,male
ALAN TURING," Thanks, no.",male
ALAN TURING, I’m quite good with those.,male
ALAN TURING, Clearly.,male
ALAN TURING, You’ve read my published work.,male
ALAN TURING," Because I’m sitting in a police station, accused of entreating a young man to touch my penis, and you’re asking me whether machines can think.",male
ALAN TURING, Most people say no.,male
ALAN TURING, The problem is that you’re asking a stupid question.,male
ALAN TURING," Of course machines can’t think human beings do.” A machine is different from a human being; hence, it would think differently. The interesting question is, just because something thinks differently from you, does that mean it’s not thinking? We allow that humans have such divergences from one another. You like strawberries. I hate ice-skating. You cry at sad films. I’m allergic to pollen. What does it mean to have different tastes preferences that our brains work differently? That we think differently from one another? And if we can say that about each another, why can’t we say the same for brains made of copper and steel?",male
ALAN TURING, “The Imitation Game.”,male
ALAN TURING, ... Would you like to play?,male
ALAN TURING," The game. It’s a test, of sorts. For determining whether something is a machine, or a human being.",male
ALAN TURING," There’s a judge, and a subject. The judge asks questions, and based on the subject’s answers, he determines: Who is he speaking with? What is he speaking with? All you have to do is ask me a question.",male
ALAN TURING, I worked in a radio factory.,male
ALAN TURING, ... Are you paying attention?,male
ALAN TURING, It’s searching... It’s just... It doesn’t know what it’s searching for... If only we knew what the messages were going to say...,male
ALAN TURING, Helen? Works with Joan in the WREN’s hut.,male
ALAN TURING, How can you possibly know that?,male
ALAN TURING, Why me?,male
ALAN TURING, No I don’t —,male
ALAN TURING," I’m flattered, but this is not actually",male
ALAN TURING, How do you mean you work alongside a German?,male
ALAN TURING, HELEN!!!,male
ALAN TURING, Why do you think your German counterpart has a girlfriend?,male
ALAN TURING, Tell me.,male
ALAN TURING, That’s impossible. The Germans are instructed to choose five letters at random to start every message.,male
ALAN TURING," — In this case, love just lost the Germans the whole bloody war.",male
ALAN TURING, What if Christopher doesn’t have to search through all the settings? What if he only had to search the ones that produce the words we already know will be in the message?,male
ALAN TURING," Yes! That’s it! They send a weather report at 6AM. Every day. That means there are three words we already know will be in the obviously, and",male
ALAN TURING, Heil bloody Hitler.,male
ALAN TURING, Hugh — the right hand letter-rings. Set them to —,male
ALAN TURING," — Peter, John — Run voltage from those rings through the back scramblers —",male
ALAN TURING," — Yes. Joan, what’s the last 6am message?",male
ALAN TURING, Give me a fresh message. The last one we intercepted.,male
ALAN TURING, Turns out that’s the only German you need to know to break Enigma.,male
ALAN TURING, No.,male
ALAN TURING, No. No.,male
ALAN TURING, NO.,male
ALAN TURING, NO!!!,male
ALAN TURING, No. No. You can’t call Denniston. You can’t tell him about the attack.,male
ALAN TURING, No. Let the U-Boats sink the convoy.,male
ALAN TURING," Do you know why people like violence, Hugh? Because it feels good. It would feel good to blow those U- Boats out of the Atlantic. But sometimes we can’t do what feels good. We have to do what’s logical.",male
ALAN TURING, The hardest time to lie is when the other person is expecting to be lied to.,male
ALAN TURING," If they’re waiting for a lie, you can’t just give them one.",male
ALAN TURING, What will the Germans think if we destroy those U-Boats?,male
ALAN TURING, Suddenly our convoy veers off course and a fleet of RAF bombers magically descends on the location of a pack of U-Boats? What will the Germans think?,male
ALAN TURING, Two years of work. Everything we’ve done here. It’ll all be for nothing.,male
ALAN TURING, Our job wasn’t to save one passenger convoy. It was to win the war.,male
ALAN TURING, Done. Now for the hard part: keeping it a secret. Forever.,male
ALAN TURING, So?,male
ALAN TURING, I’m sorry.,male
ALAN TURING, It’s not my fault.,male
ALAN TURING, I’m so sorry.,male
ALAN TURING," Yes, we do.",male
ALAN TURING, Because no one else can.,male
ALAN TURING," We need your help to keep this from the Admiralty. Army. RAF. No one can know we broke Enigma, not even Denniston.",male
ALAN TURING," While we develop a system for determining how much intelligence to act on. Which attacks to stop, which to let through. Statistical analysis. The minimum number of actions it’ll take to win the war, but the maximum number we’re able to take before the Germans get suspicious.",male
ALAN TURING, Correct.,male
ALAN TURING, We’ll require a believable alternate source for each piece of information we use.,male
ALAN TURING, And the rest of our military.,male
ALAN TURING, They codenamed it,male
ALAN TURING, And it quickly became the largest store of military intelligence in the history of the world.,male
ALAN TURING, It was like having a tap on Himmler’s intercom.,male
ALAN TURING, Secrecy became the primary concern. And for some reason they trusted me.,male
ALAN TURING," Peter, do you have the 9:30 decrypts",male
ALAN TURING, I’ll tell Denniston.,male
ALAN TURING, I need to speak to Menzies,male
ALAN TURING, Joan! Joan! Are you there?,male
ALAN TURING, — Joan?!?,male
ALAN TURING," Joan, are you okay? Where are you?",male
ALAN TURING, Where’s Joan?,male
ALAN TURING, What have you done?,male
ALAN TURING, I gave those to her. A year ago. When she was with the clerks I was—,male
ALAN TURING, I know who the Soviet agent is. It’s not Joan.,male
ALAN TURING, ... I found the bible... The spy is John Cairncross.,male
ALAN TURING, You knew Cairncross was the spy?,male
ALAN TURING, You placed a Soviet agent at Bletchley?,male
ALAN TURING, I’m not a spy. I’m just a mathematician.,male
ALAN TURING, You must promise to get Joan out of prison.,male
ALAN TURING, ... I need you to leave Bletchley.,male
ALAN TURING, Menzies. I don’t trust...,male
ALAN TURING, ... I don’t think it’s safe here.,male
ALAN TURING," You need to leave, and you need to get very far away from me.",male
ALAN TURING, ... We can’t be engaged anymore. Your parents will have to take you back and find you a husband elsewhere.,male
ALAN TURING, ... There’s something I have to tell you. I’m... I’m a homosexual.,male
ALAN TURING," Men, Joan. Not women.",male
ALAN TURING, I just said —,male
ALAN TURING, I don’t.,male
ALAN TURING," Care for you. I never did. I only needed you to break Enigma. And now I’ve done it, so you can leave.",male
ALAN TURING, The war dragged on for another two solitary years.,male
ALAN TURING, Every day we performed our blood- soaked calculus. Every day we decided who lived and who died. And every day we guided the Allied armies to victory without anyone knowing.,male
ALAN TURING, Stalingrad? The Ardennes? Normandy? None of those victories would have been possible without the intelligence we produced.,male
ALAN TURING," People talk about the war as this epic battle between civilizations. Good versus evil, liberty versus tyranny. Armies of millions bleeding into the mud, fleets of ships that weighed down the oceans, packs of airplanes that dropped bombs until they blotted out the sun itself. But it wasn’t.",male
ALAN TURING, The war was really just a half- dozen crossword enthusiasts in a tiny village in the south of England.,male
ALAN TURING, Was I God? No. Because God didn’t win the war. I did.,male
ALAN TURING, This war is over. But there will be more. And we know how to break a code that everyone else thinks is unbreakable.,male
ALAN TURING, That’s the Imitation Game.,male
ALAN TURING," Now, Detective, you get to judge. That’s how the game works. I answered your questions. You know my story. That’s the point of the game. We are all pretending to be something. Imitating something. Someone. And we are no more, and no less, than what we can convince other people that we are. So tell me: What am I? Am I a person? Am I a machine? Am I a war hero? Am I a criminal?",male
ALAN TURING, Well then you’re no help to me at all.,male
ALAN TURING, And what would you have said? That I wasn’t a homosexual?,male
ALAN TURING, Damn it...,male
ALAN TURING, No I’m not.,male
ALAN TURING, ... It’s the medication.,male
ALAN TURING, I have to go in for weekly oestrogen treatments. At the hospital.,male
ALAN TURING, The judge gave me a choice. Prison. Or,male
ALAN TURING, — Chemical castration. Yes. To cure my homosexual predilections. Of course I chose that. I wouldn’t be able to work from prison.,male
ALAN TURING, Well how would I even have got parts in jail? It just makes no sense.,male
ALAN TURING, No.,male
ALAN TURING, — I’m fine.,male
ALAN TURING, I don’t need your help.,male
ALAN TURING, Alone? I’m not alone. I never have been.,male
ALAN TURING," ... Christopher has got so smart. If I stop the treatment, they’ll take him away from me. You can’t let them do that. You can’t. Don’t let them leave me alone.",male
ALAN TURING, ... It’s a much nicer ring than the one I got you.,male
ALAN TURING, ... Perhaps later.,male
ALAN TURING, ... At least it worked out for one of us.,male
ALAN TURING, Is that what you think?,male
ALAN TURING, Well then.,male
ALAN TURING, Any questions?,male
SGT. STAEHL," Bit late, don’t you think?",male
SGT. STAEHL," Turing, Alan. Professor at King’s. Seems there’s been a robbery.",male
SGT. STAEHL," That’s just it. Nothing’s missing, really.",male
SGT. STAEHL," Maths. Or, as he put it, “ordinal logic, with a dose of number theory.”",male
SGT. STAEHL," Something with machines. Project at the NPL, I checked, but he won’t say what it’s on.",male
SGT. STAEHL, That’s putting it mildly.,male
SGT. STAEHL," You had a break in last night. Your neighbor, a Mr. Springborn, called to report the noise. Only you say there’s nothing missing. Odd. So how about it — You tell us what happened, and we find the chap who did this.",male
SGT. STAEHL, I’ll give you a bob if you can name me a more insufferable sod.,male
SGT. STAEHL," Oh, you’ve a soft spot for the bastard your drink? Which, while we’re on the subject",male
SGT. STAEHL, Don’t know what you mean.,male
SGT. STAEHL, I don’t think this is suspicious.,male
SGT. STAEHL, What’re you suggesting?,male
SGT. STAEHL, ... So are you going to catch this mysterious thief who hasn’t actually stolen anything?,male
SGT. STAEHL, “Suspect”? I distinctly recall writing his name next to the word “victim.” (which we don’t) in the reflection of a shop,male
SGT. STAEHL, Yes?,male
SGT. STAEHL, What?,male
SGT. STAEHL, What is wrong with you?,male
SGT. STAEHL, ... Whose is this?,male
SGT. STAEHL, ... That man you knocked over! You stole his billfold.,male
SGT. STAEHL, ... Oh. Bob?,male
SGT. STAEHL, There’s a photograph of you.,male
SGT. STAEHL, That man was following you.,male
SGT. STAEHL," Good God... Your home address, your district, your... Bob, there is a letter here from the Foreign Office.",male
SGT. STAEHL, Bugger off.,male
SGT. STAEHL, Why are you being followed? We have to call this in.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," The baby. Up all night, hollering and crying. June says it’s collick. What’s all this, then?",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, What of?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," No, what’s he a professor of?",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, What’s he doing in Manchester?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," He’s a bit squirrely then, our Professor Turing?",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Professor Turing? Professor Turing? My name is Detective Nock. Manchester Police. Sergeant Staehl here tells me you’ve had a robbery last night. Professor Turing?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Professor,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Pardon me?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Breathe?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, What is all that?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Pardon?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," Sergeant Staehl, is it just me, or do you get the sense that we’re being insulted?",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, ... We won by four. Would’ve been unseemly not to celebrate.,male

DETECTIVE NOCK, I’m suggesting that Alan Turing is hiding something.,male

DETECTIVE NOCK, Come with me.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Alan Turing is a suspect in a robbery but they won’t share a thing with the police?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Will?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, I’m terribly sorry about this.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Oww! Would you stop it?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Here.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Yes?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Has been for awhile now.,male

DETECTIVE NOCK," Pardon me. I’d like to see some documents, if I may. Service records of a Mr. Turing. Alan.",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Foreign Office sent me.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Alan Turing’s classified military file.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Exactly.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Yes.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," Alan Turing’s war records aren’t just classified. They’re non- existent. That means someone got rid of them. Erased them, burned them.",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, What if Turing wasn’t just a math professor?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," The Soviet spies. But first, they were professors, weren’t they? Newspapers say they became radicalized at Cambridge. Then they joined the Communist Party, took positions in the Foreign Office and leaked information to Stalin during the war. Now, can you think of anyone else we know who was at Cambridge, then took up something murky and top secret when the war broke out?",male
DETECTIVE NOCK," Something very serious is happening, right here under our noses. Wouldn’t you like to find out what it is?",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, He said alright. Let’s do it. Let’s follow Turing. You’ll take the first shift. Turing won’t have a secret left by the time we’re through with him.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, What?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, No.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK," No, it’s not.",male
DETECTIVE NOCK," No. No. This is bloody rubbish. Turing is up to something important, not getting his jollies in some pub.",male
DETECTIVE NOCK, I don’t care if it’s disgusting. This is not the investigation I was conducting.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Wait. Let me interrogate him.,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, Please. I know him. I know he’s hiding something and I know I can get him to talk... Give me half an hour alone and then I swear to you I will spend the next month running errands on as many rubbish cases as you like.,male

DETECTIVE NOCK, I’m here to help you.,male

DETECTIVE NOCK, Can they? Could machines ever think as human beings do?,male
DETECTIVE NOCK, You’re not most people.,male

COMMANDER DENNISTON, In my office? She tell you to help yourself to a cup of tea while you were here?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," She didn’t tell you what a joke is then either, I gather.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, For Christ’s sake,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Turing... Let me see... Oh, Turing. The mathematician.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, How ever could I have guessed?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," ... King’s College, Cambridge. Says here you were a bit of a prodigy in the maths department.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," How old are you, Mr. Turing?",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, How old were you when you became a fellow at Cambridge?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," And how old were you when you published this paper here, that has a title I can barely understand, which apparently got you this fellowship?",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, And you don’t think that qualifies you as a certified prodigy?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, And how old were they?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," You’re serious, aren’t you?",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Not sure you know what those are.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Commander Denniston, of the Royal Navy. All right, Mr. Turing, I’ll bite. Why do you want to work for His Majesty’s government?",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Are you a bleeding pacifist, Turing?",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, But you realize that London there’s this nasty chap named Hitler who’s looking to engulf Europe in tyranny?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, I believe you’ve just set a record for the shortest job interview in British military history.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, You’re the best mathematician in the world?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, ... Do you know how many people I’ve rejected for this program?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," That’s right. Because we’re a top secret program. But I’ll tell you, just because we’re friends, that last week I rejected one of our great nation’s top linguists, knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, What?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," How the bloody hell are you supposed to decrypt German communications if you don’t, oh, I don’t know, speak German?",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, MARGARET!,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, MARGARET! Where are you?!,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," MARGARET!?! For the love of... This is a joke, obviously.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge, Professor.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, What makes you think that?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Enigma isn’t difficult. It’s impossible. The Americans. The French. The Russians. The Germans. Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Welcome to Enigma.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," The German navy encodes every message they send using the Enigma machine. The details of every surprise attack, of every secret convoy, of every U-Boat in the bloody Atlantic go into that thing, and out comes... Gibberish.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, It’s the crooked hand of death itself.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Our WRENs intercept thousands of radio messages a day. But to the lovely young ladies of the Women’s Royal Navy, they’re nonsense. It’s only when you feed them back into Enigma that they make sense.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Yes. Polish intelligence smuggled this out of Berlin.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Very good, Mr. Turing. To decode a message, you need to know the machine’s settings. The Germans switch settings every day, promptly at midnight. We usually intercept our first message around gives you exactly day to crack the code before it changes, and you start again.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, ... Very good.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander. I’ve personally selected him to run this unit.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Mr. Alexander won Britain’s national chess championship.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, You’re not the only one who’s good at games around here.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," You’re a team, and you’ll work as one.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, This is Stuart Menzies. MI-6.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Turing. If you’d like to discuss the complaint, I’d suggest making a proper appointment with my office.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Your fellow codebreakers are refusing to work with you. They’ve filed a formal complaint.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," If you don’t respond to the complaint, I’ll have to take it up with the Home Office.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, A hundred thousand — Why are you building a machine?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, I suggest you make an effort to try.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," ... Hugh Alexander is in charge of your unit and if he’s said no, that’s that.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," — Have you ever won a war before, Turing? I have. Do you know how it’s done? Order. Discipline. Chain of command. You’re not at University any longer. You are a very small cog in a very large system and you’ll do as your commanding officer instructs.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Winston Churchill. Street, London. You have a problem with my decision you can take it up with him.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Though I hate to say it... Yes.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, I did no such thing.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Thank goodness. Be a pity if we were searching the wrong one.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, There’s a spy at Bletchley Park.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Our boys intercepted this on its way to Moscow. Look familiar?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Double agents are such bastards. Isolated loners. No attachments to friends or family. Arrogant. Think they’re smart enough to get away with anything. Do you know anyone like that?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Well then. Next time, you will make a mistake. And then, I don’t even need to bother firing you — I can simply hang you for treason.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, And there’s no result in sight?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Turing! Open the bloody door!,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Open the door or we will break it down!!,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Turn that thing off.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Well then. It seems your great big expensive machine doesn’t work.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Wonderful. So you’ve broken Enigma then?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, This is my associate from the Home Office. A hundred thousand pounds is quite a lot of money. He’s here to see what you have to show for it.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Have you decrypted any German messages? A single one? Can you point to anything at all that you’ve achieved?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON," Your funding is up, and our patience has expired. It is with such great pleasure that I finally get to say this: Alan Turing, you’re fired.",male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Please escort Mr. Turing from the premises.,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, Pardon?,male
COMMANDER DENNISTON, What on earth are you saying?,male

ALAN TURING," If the Allies broke Enigma — well, this would turn into a very short war indeed. Of course you’re working on it. But you also haven’t got anywhere. If you had, you wouldn’t be hiring cryptographers out of University. You need me a lot more than I need you. I’d just as easily go work for the Germans, frankly, but they simply don’t have anything this good to work on. Our mathematicians aren’t as impressive as theirs. With one significant exception. I like solving problems, Commander. And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, But we have an Enigma machine.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, So what’s the problem? Just put the intercepted messages back in to Enigma and,male

JOHN CAIRNCROSS, I said we were going to get some lunch? Alan?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Can you hear me?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, I said we’re off to get some lunch. This is starting to get a bit repetitive.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, I had asked if you wanted to have lunch with us.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Have I offended you in some way?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Would you like to come to lunch with us?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Nevermind.,male

JOHN CAIRNCROSS, What?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, This is inhuman. Even for you.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, ... So what do we do now?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Midnight. All the work we did today is useless. But don’t worry: We’ve a few hours before tomorrow’s messages start pouring in. And we start all over again.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Don’t go over there.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," — Hugh, don’t —",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, ... What’s the use?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," The Navy thinks one of us is a Soviet double-agent, Alan.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Thanks?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, You nervous?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," If you fire them, you’ll have to fire me too.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, What’s the matter?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Because you’re a homosexual?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, I suspected. You’re not quite as much of an enigma as you think you are. Or as much as Enigma is.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," You know, in my admittedly limited experience, women tend to be a bit touchy about accidentally marrying homosexuals. I think perhaps not spreading this information around might be in your best interest.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," You can’t tell anyone, Alan. It’s illegal. And Denniston is looking for any excuse he can get to put you away.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," This has to stay a secret, or trust me, they’ll kill you for it.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, We’re soon out of time. Our month...,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," If we knew what the messages were going to say, we wouldn’t have to decrypt them at all.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Half crown says Alan bollockses this up entirely.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, — So we’ll use the loops?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Not a hugger. Probably could have guessed that.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, There are five people in the world who know the position of every ship in the Atlantic. They are all in this room.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, You’re right. Those U-Boats are only twenty or thirty minutes away.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, And knock out a whole German fleet in the process.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," Should be. If we can get a message to the passenger convoy, she can turn",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, We can have air support over the passenger convoy in ten minutes.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," Look, this has been a big day, maybe you’re going through a bit of shock",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Everyone stop. Please. Calm down.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, What’s logical?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, What?,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, No. No. You can’t be right.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, There are 500 people in that convoy. Civilians. Women. Children. We’re about to let them die.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Alan is right. We can’t.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Peter will come around eventually.,male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," ... Jack, could you give Alan and I a moment?",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," ... The Soviets and us, we’re all on the same side. What I’m doing will help Britain.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS," No you won’t. Because if you tell him my secret, I’ll tell him yours.",male
JOHN CAIRNCROSS, Do you know what they do to homosexuals? You’ll never be able to work again. Never be able to teach. Your precious machine doubt you’ll ever see him again.,male

HUGH ALEXANDER, We’re the best cryptographic minds in Britain. Are you going to fire us all?,male
HUGH ALEXANDER," At least give us more time. Six more months, and if the machine doesn’t produce results we’ll go back to doing things the old way.",male
HUGH ALEXANDER, This machine better bloody work.,male
HUGH ALEXANDER," ... So she’s got it in her hands, right, and she looks up at me and says, “I’m to put it in my mouth?” And I say, “yes, you know. The French way.” So she pops it in, closes her lips around the thing... And then she starts humming the bloody Marseillaise!",male
HUGH ALEXANDER," Soon enough, you lucky bastard.",male
HUGH ALEXANDER," No no, your fiancé can dance with you anytime he likes. Now it’s my turn.",male
HUGH ALEXANDER, Damn it!,male
HUGH ALEXANDER," It does not matter how much we improve on it, that machine will never be able to check 159 million million million possibilities in time.",male

HUGH ALEXANDER, She wants me to come over.,male
HUGH ALEXANDER, She smiled at me awhile back and hasn’t looked again since.,male
HUGH ALEXANDER," And... Brilliant. She’s in. Alan, introduce me.",male
HUGH ALEXANDER, Because there is nothing like a friend’s engagement to make a woman want to do something she will later regret with the fiancé’s better- looking chum.,male
HUGH ALEXANDER, Alan Turing has a theory.,male
HUGH ALEXANDER," He believes that the regulations against men and women working side- by-side are sound, because such proximity will necessarily lead to romance.",male
HUGH ALEXANDER," — However, I disagree.",male
HUGH ALEXANDER," I think that if I were working beside a woman all day long, I could manage to appreciate her abilities and intellect without needing to take her to bed. Pardon, have we met?",male

STEWART MENZIES," — If you can’t play together, then I’m afraid we can’t let you play at all.",male

STEWART MENZIES, Three.,male
STEWART MENZIES, ... While we’ve been having this conversation. Oh look. There’s another. Rather hope he didn’t have a family. This war that Commander Denniston’s been going on about? We’re not winning it. Break the code and at least we might have a chance. Shall we leave the children alone with their new toy?,male
STEWART MENZIES, Possibly.,male
STEWART MENZIES, But Churchill did.,male
STEWART MENZIES," ... Popular at school, were you?",male
STEWART MENZIES, Who are they?,male
STEWART MENZIES, And you think they’re qualified for Bletchley because they’re good at crossword puzzles?,male
STEWART MENZIES, Six minutes? Is that even possible?,male
STEWART MENZIES, Seems like some people approach it by simply doing the impossible.,male
STEWART MENZIES," Congratulations, and my warmest welcome to His Majesty’s service. If you speak a word of anything I’m about to show you, you’ll be executed for High Treason. You will lie to your friends, your family, everyone you meet about what it is you really do.",male
STEWART MENZIES, ... Why are you telling me this?,male
STEWART MENZIES, Who is in the process of having you fired.,male

STEWART MENZIES," Alan, I so rarely have cause to say this. But you are exactly the man I always hoped you would be.",male
STEWART MENZIES, Military prison.,male
STEWART MENZIES, Decoded Enigma intercepts. A stack of them under her nightstand.,male
STEWART MENZIES," — Yes yes yes, I’m sure. But Denniston has been looking for a Soviet spy, and he’s been looking for one inside Hut",male
STEWART MENZIES," ... God, how I wish you’d been the spy. You’re so much better at this than he is.",male
STEWART MENZIES, Well of course Cairncross was the bloody spy.,male
STEWART MENZIES, You said yourself he was a piss- poor mathematician.,male
STEWART MENZIES, It’s quite useful to be able to leak whatever we like to Stalin.,male
STEWART MENZIES, Churchill is too damned paranoid. He won’t share a shred of intelligence with the Soviets.,male
STEWART MENZIES, Even information that will help them against the Germans. So much secrecy...,male
STEWART MENZIES," Cairncross has no idea we know, of course. Really not the brightest bulb.",male
STEWART MENZIES," That’s why I’ll need your help now to work out what to leak to John. What to feed the Soviets, as well as the British.",male
STEWART MENZIES," I know a lot of spies, Alan. You’re holding on to more secrets than the best of them.",male
STEWART MENZIES," She’s at the market. She’ll be back in an hour. I lied. I’d better hold on to these. If anyone finds out about them, prison will be the least of her worries.",male
STEWART MENZIES, Oh Alan. We’re going to have such a wonderful war together.,male
STEWART MENZIES, Yes. You’ve only one thing left to do before your service to your government is concluded.,male
STEWART MENZIES, Burn everything.,male
STEWART MENZIES, We told you when you started that this was a top secret program. Did you think we were joking?,male
STEWART MENZIES," Alright. Tear it down, light it up, sweep away the ashes. None of you have ever met before. None of you have ever even heard the word Enigma. Have a safe trip home.",male

MI-6 AGENT," No, ma’am, the secretaries are to head upstairs. This room is for the candidates.",female
MI-6 AGENT, For what position?,female
MI-6 AGENT," Yes, so, secretaries are to head upstairs.",female
MI-6 AGENT," Miss, did you really solve this puzzle yourself?",female
MI-6 AGENT, — Ma’am I’ll have to ask you —,female
JOAN CLARKE, Apologies for my tardiness caught a flat tire.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I’m only a few minutes late. With the bombing there’s ten potholes to each road.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I am a candidate.,male
JOAN CLARKE," The letter did not say, precisely.",male
JOAN CLARKE, It said it was top secret.,male
JOAN CLARKE, There was a crossword in the paper. I solved it. I got a letter saying I was a candidate for some mysterious job. So here I am. My name is Joan Clarke.,male
JOAN CLARKE, What makes you think I couldn’t have solved the puzzle myself? I am quite,male
JOAN CLARKE, Apologies again for being late.,male
JOAN CLARKE," — Pardon, but before we start, can you tell me a bit about this position I’m qualifying for?",male
JOAN CLARKE," It’s just that I’ve a pretty decent job at the University, and I’d rather not give it up for something less interesting.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Yes.,male
JOAN CLARKE, You said to do it in under 6.,male
JOAN CLARKE, And what is it that we’re really doing?,male
JOAN CLARKE, ... Well that does sound more interesting than my university job.,male
JOAN CLARKE," So kind of you to visit, Mr. Turing. Was your trip pleasant?",male
JOAN CLARKE, I’m sorry. I am unable to accept your offer.,male
JOAN CLARKE," As my father told you, it is felt — well we feel — that such a position would hardly be appropriate.",male
JOAN CLARKE, But sadly was not granted the opportunity to become a Fellow.,male
JOAN CLARKE," I’m sorry, but for someone in my position to work - to live - amongst all of your men, so far from home... It would be indecorous.",male
JOAN CLARKE, — One lump or two?,male
JOAN CLARKE, So I would be working amongst these women?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Well. I will have to talk this over with my family.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Why are you helping me?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Mr. Turing. Why are you helping me?,male
JOAN CLARKE," Could you have made a bit more noise, Alan? Not sure you woke up my landlady.",male
JOAN CLARKE, The best I can do. No male visitors after dark.,male
JOAN CLARKE, What’d you bring me?,male
JOAN CLARKE," ... Some men try flowers, you know.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Or chocolates. Girls like chocolate.,male
JOAN CLARKE," “0600 hours. Weather today is clear. Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler.” Well, clearly that vital information is going to win us the war.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Who’s,male
JOAN CLARKE, You named him?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Nevermind... Are you trying to build your Universal Machine?,male
JOAN CLARKE, I read your paper at university.,male
JOAN CLARKE," Oh God no, but I was precocious. You theorized a machine that can solve any problem. It doesn’t just do one thing: It does everything. The machine isn’t only programmable, it’s re-programmable.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Is that part of the idea behind your Christopher?,male
JOAN CLARKE, A,male
JOAN CLARKE, My landlady. You need to leave.,male
JOAN CLARKE, — No. The window. She’s coming.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Go.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I heard about what happened... I have an idea of what might cheer you up.,male
JOAN CLARKE," ... So because no letter can be encoded as itself, you’ve already a handful of settings that can be rejected at the outset. If you",male
JOAN CLARKE, Is that your team? Let’s say hello.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Over here!,male
JOAN CLARKE, Correct.,male
JOAN CLARKE," He doesn’t, really, he just sort of sips at the foam.",male
JOAN CLARKE, ... Clarke.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Please.,male
JOAN CLARKE," Well then, I’ll show you a trick. Alex! We’re in need of supplies.",male
JOAN CLARKE," Did you ever notice that the bubbles in a pint of Guinness travel downwards, as opposed to upwards in any other beer? Ever wonder why? It’s because the pint glass creates drag on the bubbles along the side; but the center bubbles are free to sprint upwards. Then the rising current in the middle pushes down on the side bubbles and... And voila: Guinness. The official beer of mathematicians.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Hugh was being sarcastic.,male
JOAN CLARKE, We’ll be there in a moment.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Yes.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Yes.,male
JOAN CLARKE," Because I’m a woman in a man’s job and I don’t have the luxury of being an ass. Alan, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. Enigma is smarter. If you really want to beat it — if you really want to solve your puzzle — you’re going to need all the help you can get. And they are not going to help you if they do not like you.",male
JOAN CLARKE, That’s Alan for,male
JOAN CLARKE, Alan?,male
JOAN CLARKE, We should talk.,male
JOAN CLARKE," Alan, I’m leaving.",male
JOAN CLARKE, No. Bletchley.,male
JOAN CLARKE, It’s my parents... I am twenty-five and I am unmarried and I am living alone... And they want me home.,male
JOAN CLARKE, That’s my parents.,male
JOAN CLARKE, “I’ll miss you.” That’s what a normal person might say in this situation.,male
JOAN CLARKE, “I’ll write.” That’d work too.,male
JOAN CLARKE," What am I supposed to do, Alan? I will not give up my parents. The world is burning to ash and they are my family and they want me home.",male
JOAN CLARKE," — And end up like you? No thanks. I’m sorry you’re lonely. I’m sorry no one likes you. But Enigma will not save you. Can you decypher that, you fragile narcissist? Or do you need me to fetch your precious Christopher for help?",male
JOAN CLARKE, ... I’m sorry.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I know.,male
JOAN CLARKE," I like talking to you, too, Alan.",male
JOAN CLARKE, You have one in mind?,male
JOAN CLARKE," Hugh is terribly attractive, I’ll give you that, but he’s really not the marrying type.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Peter? He’s so quiet...,male
JOAN CLARKE, Oh dear Lord.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Did you just propose to me?,male
JOAN CLARKE, This is ridiculous.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I cannot believe this is happening.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Elizabeth.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I know it’s not an ordinary ring...,male
JOAN CLARKE, ... But who ever loved ordinary?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Care for a dance?,male
JOAN CLARKE," Come on, now it’s your turn.",male
JOAN CLARKE," Hugh? Bit of a cad, actually.",male
JOAN CLARKE," Here, I’ll introduce you.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Are you sure?,male
JOAN CLARKE," Is it odd that when I was single this game felt tedious, but now it seems just dreadfully fun?",male
JOAN CLARKE, He has many.,male
JOAN CLARKE," Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.",male
JOAN CLARKE, That’s what flirting looks like. In case you were curious.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Alan?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Like this? “0600 hours. Weather today is clear. Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler.”,male
JOAN CLARKE, Here’s the 6 o’clock message from this morning.,male
JOAN CLARKE, L - H - W - A - U - Q - X - K...,male
JOAN CLARKE, Oh my good God.,male
JOAN CLARKE, There’s going to be an attack on a British passenger convoy. There.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Civilians. Hundreds of them. We can save their lives.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Is there enough time to save them?,male
JOAN CLARKE," Alan, are you all right? What’s going on?",male
JOAN CLARKE, Alan!,male
JOAN CLARKE," If you hurt him, you will just barely live to regret it.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Oh my God.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Oh my God. Damn it. Alan’s right.,male
JOAN CLARKE, They’ll put a halt on radio communication by noon.,male
JOAN CLARKE, What?,male
JOAN CLARKE," What’s gotten into you, Peter?",male
JOAN CLARKE, You’ll take care of that.,male
JOAN CLARKE, And then MI-6 can come up with the lies we’ll tell everyone else.,male
JOAN CLARKE," A false story that exlains how we got that information, that has nothing to do with Enigma. And then you’ll need to leak those stories to the Germans.",male
JOAN CLARKE, Can you do that?,male
JOAN CLARKE, What?,male
JOAN CLARKE, You think it’s safe somewhere else?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Alan. What’s happened?,male
JOAN CLARKE, What is wrong with you?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Alright.,male
JOAN CLARKE, So what?,male
JOAN CLARKE," — So what? I had my suspicions. I always did. But we’re not like other people. We love each other in our own way, and we can still live the life together that we want. You won’t be the perfect husband? I can promise you I harboured no intention of being the perfect wife. I’ll not be fixing your lamb all day awaiting your return from the office, will I? I’ll work.",male
JOAN CLARKE, What?,male
JOAN CLARKE," I am not going anywhere. I have spent entirely too much of my life worried about what you think of me, or what my parents think of me, or what the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3 think, and you know I am done with it. This work is the most important thing I will ever do in my life. And no one will stop me. Least of all you.",male
JOAN CLARKE, ... They were right. John. Hugh. Peter. You really are a monster.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I had to find out from the bloody newspapers.,male
JOAN CLARKE, ... You never responded to my letters. I would have come. I would have testified.,male
JOAN CLARKE, I would have said something. This is serious. They could send you to jail —,male
JOAN CLARKE, Your hands... You’re twitching.,male
JOAN CLARKE, Alan.,male
JOAN CLARKE, The medication?,male
JOAN CLARKE, What are you talking about?,male
JOAN CLARKE, Oh my god. Oh my god. That’s —,male
JOAN CLARKE, All right. This is what we’re going to do. I’m going to speak to your doctors. I’m going to speak to your lawyer. We’re going to find a way out of this.,male
JOAN CLARKE, You are not thinking clearly. There are a million chemicals flowing through your brain. This treatment—,male
JOAN CLARKE, Please let me help you.,male
JOAN CLARKE, You do not have to do this all alone.,male
JOAN CLARKE," Here, it’s alright. It’s alright. Sit down.",male
JOAN CLARKE, His name is Jock. We work together in Eastcote. He’s gotten me into coin collecting. Can you believe it?,male
JOAN CLARKE," Do you want to do a crossword? For old times’ sake. It’ll only take five minutes. Or in your case, six.",male
JOAN CLARKE," But no one normal could have done this. This morning I took a train through a city that would not exist if it wasn’t for you. I bought a ticket from a man who would likely be dead if it wasn’t for you. I read up on my work, a whole field of scientific inquiry that only exists because of you. If you wish you could have been promise you, I do not. The world is an infinitely better place precisely because you weren’t.",male
JOAN CLARKE, ... I think that sometimes it is the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, What is this?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, It’s bloody empty.,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, It’s an empty manila envelope.,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH," Well you’ve cracked the case wide open then, haven’t you?",male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, And that person broke into his house and stole... Nothing?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, You think maybe he also teaches English lit?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, The spies? From the papers?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, You think Alan Turing might be a Soviet agent?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, No. I wouldn’t. I like my job. Now as to yours: Those lads have been causing a ruckus down by Whitworth Park again. Will you give them a talking to? Thank you.,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, Can I help you?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, Got who?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, You and I will discuss this later. Sergeant.,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH," This is good work, Sergeant. Quite good.",male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH," He committed a crime. He broke the law. And with a bloke, Christ, it’s bloody disgusting.",male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, Clearly. Bring him in.,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, You’re asking me for a favour right now?,male
SUPERINTENDANT SMITH, ... Fine. Now will someone get a warrant for the arrest of Alan Turing?,male
SERGEANT STAEHL, Well? What’d he say?,male
SERGEANT STAEHL," Sirs, I think I’ve got him.",male
SERGEANT STAEHL, Turing.,male
SERGEANT STAEHL," I trailed Turing to a pub last night, where he met a bloke. They exchanged an envelope. So I followed the guy, picked him up, gave him a good shake... Here, I’ll show you.",male
SERGEANT STAEHL, He’s a bloody poofter. He confessed.,male
SERGEANT STAEHL," The man admitted it. Arnold Murray. Bit of a hustler. Hangs around that pub, men pay him for a go. Turing is one of the men who paid. Only, Mr. Murray got the bright idea to rob Turing’s house after, with a friend. That’s what Turing was hiding: He’s a poof, not a spy.",male
SERGEANT STAEHL, What’s the matter? We can charge a university professor with indecency.,male
JACK GOOD, ... What just happened?,unknown
MILITARY POLICEMAN, Don’t move!,unknown
MILITARY POLICEMAN," Nothing out of the ordinary, Sir.",unknown
TEACHER," Mr. Turing! Passing notes, are we?",unknown
TEACHER, Only Mr. Turing would pass notes written in gibberish.,unknown
TEACHER," Alright you lot, do not forget your calculus over break. Have a pleasant holiday and we’ll resume your integrals when you return.",unknown
ELECTRICAL ASSISTANT, The gears just keep spinning and spinning. It’s endless.,unknown
JOAN’S FRIEND, ... It’s... beautiful?,unknown
HELEN, Who’s Alan’s friend?,female
HELEN, So my type then?,female
HELEN," No! Lord, engaged for a fortnight and you’ve already forgotten how to do this? He’ll come over.",female
HELEN, Yes. I smiled at him fifteen minutes ago and haven’t looked at him since.,female
HELEN, And... Got him.,female
HELEN, You do?,female
HELEN, I don’t recall. But let’s assume we haven’t.,female
HELEN," Well, Alan, of course.",female
HELEN," I work beside a man every day, and I can’t help but have developed a bit of a crush on him.",female
HELEN," Oh, it’s been chaste, you’ve no need to worry. We’ve never even met. He’s a German.",female
HELEN," Each of us intercepts messages from a specific German radio tower. So we’ve a counterpart on the other side, who’s tip-tapping out the messages. Everybody types a touch differently; you get to know the rhythm of your counterpart. It’s strangely intimate. I feel as if we know each other. Pity he has a girlfriend... But that’s why I disagree with you. I’m in love with a co-worker, of sorts, even if we’ve never met.",female
HELEN, Let’s.,female
HELEN," Yes, Alan?",female
HELEN," Oh, it’s a stupid joke, don’t worry about it.",female
HELEN, Each one of his messages begins with the same five letters. C-I-L-L- Y. So I suspect Cilly must be the name of his amore.,female
HELEN," Well, this bloke doesn’t.",female
JOAN CLARKE, And they’ll have the design of Enigma changed by the weekend.,male
JOAN CLARKE, You’ll work. We’ll have each other’s company. We’ll have each other’s minds. Sounds like a better marriage than most. Because I care for you. And you care for me. And we understand one another more than anyone else ever has.,male
STEWART MENZIES, I’ve known that since before he got to Bletchley. Why do you think I had him placed here?,male
STEWART MENZIES," Behave, and with a bit of luck none of you will ever see me — or one another",male
HEADMASTER, Turing. Sit down.,male
HEADMASTER, You and Christopher Morcom are quite close.,male
HEADMASTER, Your mathematics teacher says you two are positively inseparable.,male
HEADMASTER, He caught you passing notes the other day.,male
HEADMASTER, You and your friend solve maths problems during maths class because maths class is too dull?,male
HEADMASTER, I’ve been told he’s your only friend.,male
HEADMASTER, Something has come up. About Morcom.,male
HEADMASTER, Christopher is dead.,male
HEADMASTER," His mother sent word this morning. The family was on holiday, you see.",male
HEADMASTER," He had bovine tuberculosis, as I’m sure he told you. This mustn’t be a shock, but all the same, I’m sorry.",male
HEADMASTER," Did he not tell you? He’s been sick for a long time. Knew this was coming soon, but he had a stiff upper lip about it. Good lad.",male
HEADMASTER," Are you all right, Turing?",male
HEADMASTER, Ah. Very well then.,male
HEADMASTER," Of course. Oh, but Turing?",male
HEADMASTER," Do pay more attention in maths class, will you?",male
