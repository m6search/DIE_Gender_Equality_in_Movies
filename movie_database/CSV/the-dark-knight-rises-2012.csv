GORDON," Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for. He was...a hero. Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining...",male
GORDON, But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. I believed in Harvey Dent.,male
GORDON, Congressman.,male
GORDON," Maybe the truth about Harvey isn’t so simple, Congressman.",male
GORDON, The truth...? I have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent... Maybe the time isn’t right...,male
GORDON," Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent’s death is this...it has not been for nothing.",male
GORDON, The second shift reports in?,male
GORDON, That’s your department.,male
GORDON," What’s the problem, son?",male
GORDON, That’s a job for the police?,male
GORDON, Old habits.,male
GORDON," What’s your name, son?",male
GORDON," You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake?",male
GORDON, What about it?,male
GORDON," I’m not hearing a question, son.",male
GORDON, I know exactly who he was. (Turns to Blake.) He was Batman.,male
GORDON, Manhole!,male
GORDON," You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit -",male
GORDON," Get the DWP down here, now!",male
GORDON, We were in this together. Then you were gone...,male
GORDON, Built on a lie. Our lie. Now there’s evil rising from where we tried to bury it. Nobody will listen... The Batman has to come back.,male
GORDON, He must. He must.,male
GORDON, Why?,male
GORDON, Where did you get to with the tunnel searches?,male
GORDON," Get more men, work a grid. I want him found.",male
GORDON, This is good work. Lose the uniform - you’re working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here.,male
GORDON," You’re a detective now, son, you’re not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore.",male
GORDON, So you think our friend is gone again?,male
GORDON, What’s happened?,male
GORDON," No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out.",male
GORDON, Don’t apologize for believing the world’s in better shape then it is...just fight to make it true.,male
GORDON," Not you. You’re telling me the Batman’s gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can.",male
GORDON, But you know about patterns. Keep looking. finishes his work. Turns to Bane.,male
GORDON," Get my coat, son.",male
GORDON, It means we’re on our own. I have to get in front of a camera -,male
GORDON, The Mayor’s dead. I’m the symbol of law and order. Bane says he’s giving Gotham back to the people - they need to know that I could lead.,male
GORDON, Then he’ll show his true colors.,male
GORDON," A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in -",male
GORDON," There’s a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren’t weapons anymore, they’re shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you’ll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean.",male
GORDON," Captain, glad to have you here.",male
GORDON, Dozens. I’d rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand.,male
GORDON," They’ve been getting water, food.",male
GORDON, No leads. It’s a bluff - Bane wouldn’t give control of that bomb to someone else.,male
GORDON," Captain, things are more complicated than you think. There’s somebody you need to meet. Blake?",male
GORDON," Where the hell are they? It’s not like we have a lot of time, here.",male
GORDON, The bomb goes off tomorrow. We’ve got about eighteen hours to do something.,male
GORDON," We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down.",male
GORDON, That’s it?,male
GORDON," Foley. Where’s Foley, dammit?!",male
GORDON, You’re sending your wife to the door when the city’s under occupation?!,male
GORDON," What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?",male
GORDON, You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?,male
GORDON, Deal?! Bane’s got their balls in a vice. That’s not a deal -,male
GORDON, You think he’s given control of that bomb to one of ’the people’?! You think this is part of some revolution? There’s one man with his finger on the button - Bane.,male
GORDON," This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look, I’m not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues. But we’ve got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell.",male
GORDON," Keep your head down? What’s that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows?",male
GORDON," Miss take, I can’t ask you -",male
GORDON, Bruce Wayne built it.,male
GORDON, Let’s go.,male
GORDON," Stay further up the block. (Points at Men.) They’re gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down. As it approaches, hit this button. If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and I mark the truck. Okay?",male
GORDON, Got it.,male
GORDON, On whose authority?,male
GORDON," No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this?",male
GORDON," Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you’ve got another think coming.",male
GORDON, Looks that way.,male
GORDON, When what starts?,male
GORDON," Come on, come on...",male
GORDON, That’s impossible... Come on! Cut over to Fifth!,male
GORDON," Give me a hand! Let’s get a cable on it and drag it out! Come on, we’re almost there -",male
GORDON, What’re you doing?,male
GORDON," So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don’t come back?",male
GORDON, I never cared who you were -,male
GORDON, But shouldn’t the people know the hero who saved them?,male
GORDON, Bruce Wayne?,male
GORDON," ’I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...’ ’It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.’",male
GORDON, Can I change your mind about quitting the force?,male
GORDON, They know. (Off look.) It was Batman.,male
BANE, Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan.,male
BANE, It would be extremely painful.,male
BANE, For you.,male
BANE, Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us.,male
BANE, He would not have told us.,male
BANE," Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem.",male
BANE, Crashing this plane...,male
BANE, With no survivors.,male
BANE, Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage.,male
BANE, The fire rises.,male
BANE," Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for fear...",male
BANE, That comes later.,male
BANE, Why are you here?,male
BANE, I’m asking you.,male
BANE, And you brought him down here?,male
BANE, You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives.,male
BANE, Search him. Then I will kill you.,male
BANE, Then show me his body.,male
BANE, Give me your GPS.,male
BANE, Follow him.,male
BANE, Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel.,male
BANE, Why else would you people be here?,male
BANE, Enter your password. Or I send these men to your home.,male
BANE, For now. How much longer does the program need?,male
BANE, Time to go mobile.,male
BANE, ...and he shall appear.,male
BANE, The plan is proceeding as expected.,male
BANE, Leave us.,male
BANE, Do you feel in charge?,male
BANE, And that gives you power over me?,male
BANE, Your money and infrastructure have been important. Till now.,male
BANE, Gotham’s reckoning. Come to end the borrowed time you’ve all been living on...,male
BANE, I am necessary evil.,male
BANE," Let’s not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne.",male
BANE, Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you.,male
BANE, Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated.,male
BANE," But we are initiated, aren’t we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us...",male
BANE," Now I am the Legue of Shadows, here to fulfill Ra’s al Ghul’s destiny...",male
BANE, You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken.,male
BANE, You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it...,male
BANE, I didn’t see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding...,male
BANE," The shadows betray you, because they belong to me...",male
BANE, I will show you where I’ve made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you.,male
BANE, Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.,male
BANE, I wondered which would break first - your spirit... ...or your body.,male
BANE, You don’t fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment is to be more severe.,male
BANE, Yes. But not of your body. Of your soul.,male
BANE," Home. Where I learned the truth about despair. As will you. (Rises.) There is a reason that this prison is the worst hell on earth... Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So simple. So easy. And, like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned that there can be no true despair without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamber over each other to stay in the sun... You will watch as I torture an entire city to cause you pain you thought you could never feel again. Then, when you have truly understood the depths of your failure, we will fulfill Ra’s al Ghul’s destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And when it is done...when Gotham is ashes...then you have my permission to die.",male
BANE, This meeting is called to order.,male
BANE," Chair and President. I also need one ordinary member - Mr. Fox, would you care to nominate?",male
BANE, Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham.,male
BANE, Turn it on.,male
BANE, I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs.,male
BANE, Do your work. Take them to the surface. People of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization.,male
BANE, Pull the core out of the reactor.,male
BANE," Five, by my calculations.",male
BANE," For the sake of your family, Dr. Pavel, I hope so. stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect",male
BANE, Let the games begin.,male
BANE," Gotham, take control of your city...",male
BANE, This is the instrument of your liberation...,male
BANE, Identify yourself to the world.,male
BANE, Tell the world what this is.,male
BANE, And who can disarm this device?,male
BANE," Thank you, Doctor.",male
BANE," The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. One of you holds the detonator - we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people. At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait. Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours.",male
BANE, Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison...,male
BANE," Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good...",male
BANE, But they supplied you a false idol. A straw man. To placate. To stop you tearing down this corrupt city...,male
BANE," Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. In the words of Gotham’s Police Commissioner, James Gordon...",male
BANE," ’The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey’s mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey’s rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son’s life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved",male
BANE," ’The things we did in Harvey’s name brought desperately needed security to our streets... But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign.’ Do you accept this man’s resignation?",male
BANE, Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?!,male
BANE," We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich. The oppressors of generations who’ve kept you down with the myth of opportunity. And we give it to you, the people. Gotham is yours - none shall interfere. Do as you please...",male
BANE," I’m on your schedule, Captain.",male
BANE, Give them over for judgement. (Indicates bodies.) Hang them where the world will see.,male
BANE, Bring her to me.,male
BANE, Impossible...,male
BANE, Open fire.,male
BANE, You came back. To die with your city.,male
BANE, Stay back. He is mine -,male
BANE, I broke you. How have you come back?,male
BANE, I never escaped - Ra’s al Ghul rescued me. That is why I mist fulfill his plan. That is why I must avenge his murder.,male
BANE, Goodbye.,male
BANE, You’ll have to imagine the fire - We both know I need to kill you now.,male
CONGRESSMAN, Commissioner.,male
CONGRESSMAN, Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things?,male
CONGRESSMAN," Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.",male
CONGRESSMAN," Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? We’re gonna be here all night.",male
CONGRESSMAN, Thank Christ for that...,male
CONGRESSMAN, Anyone shown him the crime stats?,male
CONGRESSMAN, Must be popular with the wife.,male
CONGRESSMAN, He’ll have plenty of time for visits. Mayor’s dumping him in the spring.,male
CONGRESSMAN," War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the job’s yours.",male
CONGRESSMAN, You read my mind.,male
CONGRESSMAN, Call me?,male
FOLEY, No one has. Not in years.,female
FOLEY, On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor -,female
FOLEY," He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers.",female
FOLEY, Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland.,female
FOLEY, Really? He’s a hero.,female
FOLEY, And Gordon took SWAT in after them.,female
FOLEY, No one goes in there till we know what’s down there.,female
FOLEY, Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy!,female
FOLEY, This is a hostage situation -,female
FOLEY, I’m not risking my men for your money -,female
FOLEY, Cut the fiber line - shut down the cell tower. That’ll slow them down.,female
FOLEY," Back off, back off! They’ve got hostages!",female
FOLEY," Let’s roll, they’ve spotted the Batman!",female
FOLEY," Call everyone in - every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too! Pull ’em in, close every street! Now!",female
FOLEY, I’m gonna do what Gordon never could.,female
FOLEY, I’m gonna take down the Batman.,female
FOLEY, Negative! Stay on the Batman!,female
FOLEY," Who do you want to catch? Some robber, or the son-of-a-bitch who killed Harvey Dent?",female
FOLEY, How did you let him go?!,female
FOLEY," And you don’t?! We’re not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down, you hear me?!",female
FOLEY," Then he’s as dumb as he dresses - close it down, gentlemen!",female
FOLEY," Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen...",female
FOLEY," Can we help you, officer?",female
FOLEY," Remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.) We’ve had teams down there, but it’s a huge network -",female
FOLEY," Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We’re on it.",female
FOLEY," Okay, Commissioner, you were tight.",female
FOLEY," Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers.",female
FOLEY, The Mayor won’t want panic -,female
FOLEY, I’m sorry for not taking you seriously -,female
FOLEY, Foley.,female
FOLEY, Where?,female
FOLEY, Pull out! Pull ’em out!,female
FOLEY," Jesus, Blake! Every cop in the city’s down in those tunnels!",female
FOLEY, You have ID?,female
FOLEY, How can we trust you?,female
FOLEY," Wait in the kitchen, honey.",female
FOLEY," Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces.",female
FOLEY, This is different and you know it. These guys run the city - the government’s done a deal with them -,female
FOLEY," You move against Bane, the triggerman’s gonna hit the button -",female
FOLEY, We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this. If you still had family here maybe you’d -,female
FOLEY, I’m sorry Jim. I gotta -,female
FOLEY, You don’t know that’s going to happen.,female
FOLEY, There’s only one police in this city.,female
ALFRED," Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs?",male
ALFRED, Where’s Mrs. Bolton?,male
ALFRED," The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more.",male
ALFRED," I’m sorry, Miss Tate, but I’ve tried. He won’t see you.",male
ALFRED, Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones.,male
ALFRED," The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure.",male
ALFRED, Miss Tate was asking to see you again.,male
ALFRED," And quite lovely, in case you were wondering.",male
ALFRED, What are you doing?,male
ALFRED, And this is your idea of raising the alarm?,male
ALFRED, She?,male
ALFRED," Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints?",male
ALFRED, Master Wayne?,male
ALFRED, You haven’t been down here in a long time...,male
ALFRED, She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace.,male
ALFRED, We should send the police before she fences the pearls.,male
ALFRED, What was she after?,male
ALFRED, Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee.,male
ALFRED," At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world.",male
ALFRED," And that’s the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won’t get out there and find a life. Find someone -",male
ALFRED," I know. And then you lost them. That’s part of living, sir. But you’re not living - you’re waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn’t come back. Every year I took my holiday. I’d go to Florence. There’s a café by the Arno... Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca... I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine that one day I’d look across the tables, and see you. Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids. You wouldn’t say anything to me, or me to you, but we’d both know...that you’d made it. That you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and I wanted more for you than that. I still do.",male
ALFRED," I’m sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn’t take unscheduled calls. Even from police officers.",male
ALFRED, Ran it through some databases. He’s a mercenary. No other known name. Never been seen or photographed without a mask. He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.,male
ALFRED, It would seem so. I’ll keep digging.,male
ALFRED, The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises... (Off look.) There have to be some.,male
ALFRED, I’ll get him on the phone -,male
ALFRED, One or two.,male
ALFRED," Which hospital, sir?",male
ALFRED," Just you, sir?",male
ALFRED," You’ve got the wrong leg, sir.",male
ALFRED, It is terribly painful?,male
ALFRED," Happy watching, thank you, sir.",male
ALFRED," Master Wayne, if you’re considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane.",male
ALFRED," There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes...the pit sends something back.",male
ALFRED, Born and raised in a hell on earth.,male
ALFRED, No one knows why. Or how he escaped. But they know who trained him one he did...Ra’s al Ghul. Your mentor.,male
ALFRED," He plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. Just like you.",male
ALFRED, Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for Ra’s al Ghul is not to be trifled with.,male
ALFRED, That was then. And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. But it won’t make you what you were.,male
ALFRED, Someone whose anger at death made him value all life. Even his own.,male
ALFRED," Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources, your knowledge...not your body. Not your life. That time has passed.",male
ALFRED," You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, you can’t afford to.",male
ALFRED, No. I’m afraid that you want to.,male
ALFRED, Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower?,male
ALFRED," From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.",male
ALFRED, Shouldn’t the police be gathering the evidence?,male
ALFRED, They would if you gave them to them -,male
ALFRED," In your mind, perhaps. But there aren’t many things you couldn’t turn into a weapon.",male
ALFRED, Perhaps they would’ve if you haven’t made a sideshow of yourself.,male
ALFRED, Wrong?,male
ALFRED, You don’t. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then?,male
ALFRED, When you had something to fight for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life.,male
ALFRED," Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity, His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.",male
ALFRED, By Ra’s al Ghul. Who leads them now?,male
ALFRED, Is that -?,male
ALFRED, I’ll get this to Fox. But no more.,male
ALFRED, I’ve sewn you up and set your bones...but I won’t bury you. I’ve buried enough members of the Wayne family.,male
ALFRED, You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren’t Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave -,male
ALFRED, What if he had? What if she wasn’t intending to make a life with you?,male
ALFRED," What if, before she died, she’d written a letter? Explaining that she’d chosen Harvey Dent over you?",male
ALFRED," And what if, to spare you pain...I’d burned that letter?",male
ALFRED, Because I have to make you understand.,male
ALFRED, Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I haven’t.,male
ALFRED, I’ve never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachel’s letter.,male
ALFRED," I’m using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it’s time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. I’m sorry.",male
ALFRED, No. I know what this means -,male
ALFRED, It means your hatred. It means losing the person I’ve cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.,male
ALFRED," Goodbye, Bruce.",male
ALFRED," I’m so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you.",male
ALFRED," Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia.",male
MIRANDA," It’s important, Mr. Pennyworth.",female
MIRANDA," I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed?",female
MIRANDA, I’m only asking for explanations because I think I can help.,female
MIRANDA, He doesn’t talk to you either?,female
MIRANDA," Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises?",female
MIRANDA," Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things...",female
MIRANDA," Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.",female
MIRANDA," And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.",female
MIRANDA, You have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our clean-energy project...,female
MIRANDA," You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn’t care about the world doesn’t spend half his fortune on a plan to save it... (Gentle.) And isn’t so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding...",female
MIRANDA," Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.",female
MIRANDA," You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?",female
MIRANDA," This is it, isn’t it?",female
MIRANDA, Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?,female
MIRANDA," No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city.",female
MIRANDA, You’ve built a lot of security around a damp squib. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems... (Looks at Wayne.) I think this machine works.,female
MIRANDA, Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?,female
MIRANDA, And to do what with it?,female
MIRANDA, And if we can’t?,female
MIRANDA, Destroy the world’s best chance for a sustainable future?,female
MIRANDA," Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.",female
MIRANDA, Doesn’t count. You have no choice.,female
MIRANDA, Do you have keys?,female
MIRANDA, Let’s find a window.,female
MIRANDA," Fox worked the board like you’ve never seen - I’m in, Daggett’s out and he’s not happy.",female
MIRANDA, Suffering builds character.,female
MIRANDA," I’ll take care of your parents’ legacy, Bruce.",female
MIRANDA, Who’s this?,female
MIRANDA, Where’s Alfred?,female
MIRANDA, What’s that?,female
MIRANDA," When I was a child we had almost nothing. But on the nights we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed.",female
MIRANDA, Not always. Not when I was young. a scar on her shoulder.,female
MIRANDA, An old mistake.,female
MIRANDA, More than a few... (Smiles.) We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane. Go anywhere we wanted.,female
MIRANDA, Bruce got a lot of things right. Keeping the board in the dark wasn’t one of them...,female
MIRANDA," Alright, stop.",female
MIRANDA," Lucius, you’ll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down.",female
MIRANDA," And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.",female
MIRANDA," Because, Captain, we built it.",female
MIRANDA," How about me, instead?",female
MIRANDA, My company built it.,female
MIRANDA, And he wanted to destroy it. It was me who didn’t listen. Please.,female
MIRANDA, Bruce?,female
MIRANDA, Do what’s necessary.,female
MIRANDA, I know.,female
MIRANDA," I am. And though I am not ’ordinary’, I am a citizen...",female
DAGGETT," Everyone knows Wayne’s holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good of you to let me on the grounds.",male
DAGGETT, Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project? He can’t help you get your money back. But I can.,male
DAGGETT, After eight years he has to pick tonight...,male
DAGGETT, What about the men they arrested?,male
DAGGETT, Where does he find these guys? Open the champagne...,male
DAGGETT, And can we get some girls in here?,male
DAGGETT, You dumb bitch.,male
DAGGETT, Dumb to show up here tonight.,male
DAGGETT, ’I want’ never gets...,male
DAGGETT, Where’s what?,male
DAGGETT," Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I don’t have it.",male
DAGGETT, The ’Clean Slate’? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true.,male
DAGGETT, That’s why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangland myth.,male
DAGGETT," I’d like to point out that we have a non-board member here. Highly irregular, even if it is his family name above the door...",male
DAGGETT," Into the ground, sir. Anybody disagree? Check the value of your shares this morning. Gambling on crazy futures didn’t just lose Mr. Wayne his seat, it’s lost us all a lot of money. He needs to leave.",male
DAGGETT, Let’s get down to business.,male
DAGGETT, How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?! Was she meeting with Wayne? Was she sleeping with Wayne?,male
DAGGETT," Clearly you don’t ’know of’ anything, do you?! Where’s Bane?!",male
DAGGETT, Then where is the masked -,male
DAGGETT, What the hell’s going on?,male
DAGGETT," You see me running Wayne Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.) Your stock exchange hit didn’t work, friend. And now you’ve got my construction crews working all hours around the city? How’s that supposed to help my company absorb Wayne’s?",male
DAGGETT, You stay right there! I’m in charge!,male
DAGGETT, I’ve paid you a small fortune -,male
DAGGETT, What is this?,male
DAGGETT, What are you?,male
DAGGETT, You are true evil...,male
WAYNE, Is that what they say about me?,male
WAYNE, That’s a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can’t be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable.,male
WAYNE, I’m afraid I can’t let you take those.,male
WAYNE, She’s very persistent.,male
WAYNE, I wasn’t.,male
WAYNE, Examining print dust. We’ve been robbed.,male
WAYNE, She took the pearls. Tracking device and all.,male
WAYNE," One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house.",male
WAYNE, I’m not. She was.,male
WAYNE, Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - - but she was wearing someone else’s fingerprints. She’s good.,male
WAYNE," We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E’s... Selina Kyle. The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences...",male
WAYNE," She’s good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.",male
WAYNE, She won’t. She likes them too much. And they weren’t what she was after.,male
WAYNE," My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it’s untraceable.",male
WAYNE, Now you’re trying to set me up with a jewel thief?,male
WAYNE, There’s nothing out there for me.,male
WAYNE," I did find someone, Alfred.",male
WAYNE," What can I do for you, officer?",male
WAYNE, I’m sorry to hear that,male
WAYNE, Shouldn’t you be telling this to your superior officers?,male
WAYNE, If Commissioner Gordon thinks I’m the Batman he must be in a bad way -,male
WAYNE, Why did you say your boys’ home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?,male
WAYNE, You checked that name? ’Bane’ -,male
WAYNE, Now Daggett’s brought them here?,male
WAYNE, Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys’ homes in the city?,male
WAYNE," Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.",male
WAYNE, No. Do we still have any cars around the place?,male
WAYNE, And I need an appointment at the hospital. About my leg.,male
WAYNE, Whichever one Jim Gordon’s in. less excited by this part of the request.,male
WAYNE, I see you haven’t lost your sense of humor...even if you have lost most of my money.,male
WAYNE, Even with -,male
WAYNE, What’re my options?,male
WAYNE," I can’t, Lucius.",male
WAYNE," You too, Lucius?",male
WAYNE, I’ll think it over.,male
WAYNE," No, why?",male
WAYNE, I retired.,male
WAYNE, I figured you’d have shut this place down.,male
WAYNE, But all this new stuff?,male
WAYNE, Why?,male
WAYNE, It’s fine the use it gets these days.,male
WAYNE, Now you’re just showing off.,male
WAYNE, What’s it called?,male
WAYNE, What’s wrong with that?,male
WAYNE, Better mind?,male
WAYNE," I told you. I retired, Lucius.",male
WAYNE, That’s good -,male
WAYNE, The Batman wasn’t needed anymore. We won.,male
WAYNE, What if he doesn’t exist anymore?,male
WAYNE, I’m not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -,male
WAYNE," Miss Tate, isn’t it?",male
WAYNE," True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. It’s not about charity, it’s about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on.",male
WAYNE, Oh.,male
WAYNE, That’s very generous of you.,male
WAYNE, Sometimes the investment doesn’t pay off. Sorry.,male
WAYNE," Mind if I cut in? turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his the waist. She glares at him.",male
WAYNE, You don’t seem very happy to see me.,male
WAYNE, Felt like some fresh air.,male
WAYNE, I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. (Admires her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a cat burglar.,male
WAYNE," Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who’s your date?",male
WAYNE, It’s pronounced ’Ibeetha’. You wouldn’t want these folks realizing you’re a crook not a social climber.,male
WAYNE, I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.,male
WAYNE," Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you’re saving for your retirement - or you’re in deep with the wrong people.",male
WAYNE," Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.",male
WAYNE, Start fresh.,male
WAYNE, Or our achievements.,male
WAYNE, You think that justifies stealing?,male
WAYNE, Robin Hood?,male
WAYNE, Maybe you’re assuming too much.,male
WAYNE, Ouch.,male
WAYNE, Sounds like you’re looking forward to it.,male
WAYNE, These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe... But I still can’t let you keep them.,male
WAYNE, Not likely.,male
WAYNE, I must have lost my ticket -,male
WAYNE, My wife?,male
WAYNE, Remember those ’unusual requests’ I used to make?,male
WAYNE, You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns. Now we tighten it up.,male
WAYNE," You’re welcome to try it, Alfred.",male
WAYNE, Not bad - Not bad at all.,male
WAYNE, I’m all ears.,male
WAYNE, Bane.,male
WAYNE, Born in a prison?,male
WAYNE, Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.,male
WAYNE, I didn’t realize I was known for trifling with criminals.,male
WAYNE, Which was?,male
WAYNE," If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me.",male
WAYNE," I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed.",male
WAYNE, That’s what you’re afraid of - that if I go back out there I’ll fail.,male
WAYNE, We bought all the neighbors.,male
WAYNE, I retrieved this.,male
WAYNE, They don’t have the tools to analyze it.,male
WAYNE, One man’s tool is another man’s weapon.,male
WAYNE, Alfred. Enough. The police weren’t getting it done -,male
WAYNE, Perhaps you’re upset you were wrong.,male
WAYNE, You thought I didn’t have it in me.,male
WAYNE," I’ll fight harder, I always have.",male
WAYNE, You said he was excommunicated.,male
WAYNE," Ra’s al Ghul was the League of Shadows. And I beat him. Bane’s just a mercenary, and we have to find out what he’s up to.",male
WAYNE, Trades of some kind. Coded...,male
WAYNE, Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle. Get this to Fox - he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing.,male
WAYNE, You’d abandon me?,male
WAYNE, Rachel died knowing we’d decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I can’t just move on. She didn’t. She couldn’t.,male
WAYNE," She was, I can’t change that -",male
WAYNE, Why would you say such a thing?,male
WAYNE, You’re lying.,male
WAYNE, You’re lying!,male
WAYNE, How dare you use Rachel to stop me!,male
WAYNE," Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!",male
WAYNE," What does it mean, Alfred?!",male
WAYNE," Goodbye, Alfred.",male
WAYNE, Alfred?,male
WAYNE, Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive?,male
WAYNE, The weapons - we can’t let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -,male
WAYNE, Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let’s show her the reactor -,male
WAYNE, I thought you might like to see what your investment built.,male
WAYNE, If it worked. It doesn’t.,male
WAYNE," Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction.",male
WAYNE," Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.",male
WAYNE, Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.,male
WAYNE, Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.,male
WAYNE, Decommission it. Flood it.,male
WAYNE, If the world’s not ready. Yes.,male
WAYNE, I’m trusting you.,male
WAYNE," I could’ve flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I’m choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that’s not the easiest thing for me. Please.",male
WAYNE, I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.,male
WAYNE, To protect the people closest to me.,male
WAYNE," There are always people you care about. You just don’t realize how much until they’re gone. (Collects himself.) The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point.",male
WAYNE, Not everybody agrees.,male
WAYNE, Got anything on Bane’s whereabouts?,male
WAYNE, You know what? Drop me in Old Town...,male
WAYNE, Don’t wait. I’ll get a cab.,male
WAYNE," Actually, no.",male
WAYNE," Actually, they’re letting me keep the house.",male
WAYNE, Vacation?,male
WAYNE, My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving.,male
WAYNE, By giving you what you want.,male
WAYNE, He says it does. He wants Tonight.,male
WAYNE, He needs to find Bane. He you’d know how.,male
WAYNE," No, you’re not.",male
WAYNE, No. I’m on my own now.,male
WAYNE, Never needed them...,male
WAYNE, Hope you don’t like me for your money.,male
WAYNE, He left. Taking everything.,male
WAYNE, I think my power’s been shut off.,male
WAYNE, You’re pretty good at that.,male
WAYNE, I assumed your family was wealthy.,male
WAYNE," I’ve made a few myself. to him, tracing the scars across his",male
WAYNE, Someday perhaps. Not tonight. him close. He kisses her. They fold into each,male
WAYNE, Why didn’t you just kill me?,male
WAYNE, You’re a torturer...,male
WAYNE, Where am I?,male
WAYNE, Do it for the pleasure.,male
WAYNE, Has anyone made it?,male
WAYNE, What does he say?,male
WAYNE, Bane.,male
WAYNE, Don’t.,male
WAYNE, How would he know?,male
WAYNE, How?,male
WAYNE, Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?,male
WAYNE, How -?,male
WAYNE, I watched you die.,male
WAYNE, You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir.,male
WAYNE, No...,male
WAYNE, NO!,male
WAYNE, I’m not meant to die in here.,male
WAYNE, You told me a child did it...,male
WAYNE, My body makes the jump.,male
WAYNE, My soul’s as ready to escape as my body.,male
WAYNE, I’m not afraid. I’m angry.,male
WAYNE, Why?,male
WAYNE, I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it.,male
WAYNE, How?,male
WAYNE, Not yet.,male
WAYNE, It wouldn’t suit you. I need your help.,male
WAYNE, For this. The ’Clean Slate’.,male
WAYNE," I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there’s more to you. In fact, I think for you - (indicates USB) this isn’t a tool, it’s an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh. at him. Takes the drive, staring at",male
WAYNE, I can give you a way off. Once you’ve gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they’re holding him. Then take me in.,male
WAYNE, To save this city.,male
WAYNE, Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb’s going off.,male
WAYNE, I’m trying. But I need Fox.,male
WAYNE, How long until the core ignites?,male
WAYNE, Unless we can connect it to the reactor.,male
WAYNE, Not tonight. I’m sorry.,male
WAYNE, Tonight I need you.,male
WAYNE, To get me back in the game.,male
WAYNE, I won’t forget about you.,male
WAYNE, Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off.,male
WAYNE, Could you block it?,male
WAYNE, Even without the autopilot...,male
BLAKE," I didn’t want to bother you up here, but they’re looking for you.",male
BLAKE, Congressman Gilly’s wife’s been calling. He hasn’t made it home from the Wayne Foundation event.,male
BLAKE," Sir, I’ve been a cop for a year and I’ve only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned ’em good. Pretty soon we’ll be chasing overdue library books.",male
BLAKE, But here you are. Like we’re still at war...,male
BLAKE, Or instinct.,male
BLAKE," Blake, sir.",male
BLAKE," It’s that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.",male
BLAKE," The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent’s neck...then just vanishes?",male
BLAKE, Don’t you want to know who we was?,male
BLAKE, Name’s Jimmy. He’s at St. Swithin’s. (Off look.) The boys home where I...I coach some ball.,male
BLAKE, Why?,male
BLAKE, The Wayne Foundation gives money for that -,male
BLAKE," He has a brother here, right?",male
BLAKE," I’d like to, if that’s okay.",male
BLAKE, I’m sorry.,male
BLAKE, What was he doing in the tunnels?,male
BLAKE, What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?,male
BLAKE," It’s okay, Miss. It’s okay.",male
BLAKE," I’ve got the Congressman - bullet to the leg, but he’s okay.",male
BLAKE, They went down there?,male
BLAKE," Come on, we gotta get down there -",male
BLAKE, Gas? This is a sewer!,male
BLAKE," We know what’s down there, sir. The Police Commissioner!",male
BLAKE, I need to see Brice Wayne.,male
BLAKE," And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent’s murder? Would that still count as unscheduled?",male
BLAKE, Commissioner Gordon’s been shot.,male
BLAKE, He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called ’Bane’.,male
BLAKE, I did. One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there. He needs you. He needs the Batman.,male
BLAKE," He doesn’t know or care who you are. (Off look.) But we’ve met before. When I was a kid. At the orphanage. See, my mom died when I was small. Car accident, I don’t really remember it. But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot of people who what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget.",male
BLAKE," So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys’ home - St. Swithin’s. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm.",male
BLAKE," I don’t know why you took the fall for Dent’s murder, but I’m still a believer in the Batman. Even if you’re not.",male
BLAKE, Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help.,male
BLAKE," Move it, now! We’ve got a situation.",male
BLAKE, That way!,male
BLAKE, Get in your vehicle and stay there!,male
BLAKE, What’s that?,male
BLAKE," Sir, what about the armed robbers?",male
BLAKE, But he’s getting away!,male
BLAKE, Are you sure that was him?,male
BLAKE, When you began...why the mask?,male
BLAKE, You’re a loner with no family.,male
BLAKE, It was damn good to see him back.,male
BLAKE, They’ll figure it out in the end.,male
BLAKE," Yeah, I’ve got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help.",male
BLAKE, You got money?,male
BLAKE, John Daggett’s body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know.,male
BLAKE, Because Daggett’s name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham.,male
BLAKE," MTA maintenance, sewer construction...",male
BLAKE, This could just be a coincidence.,male
BLAKE, Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him I’ve got a line on the Congressman’s kidnapping.,male
BLAKE, I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what?,male
BLAKE," Head over heels. Pressing charges, though. You’ve made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.",male
BLAKE, You have an appetite. Why run? You can’t hide from us with this record.,male
BLAKE, Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?,male
BLAKE, We can offer you protection...,male
BLAKE," When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend...Bruce Wayne.",male
BLAKE, Did the kill him?,male
BLAKE, This time...he might not be coming back.,male
BLAKE, So it’s a training exercise.,male
BLAKE," I’ve been to half Daggett’s cement plants, logged locations they’ve poured for underground construction...",male
BLAKE," Honestly, Commissioner, I don’t know anything about civil engineering.",male
BLAKE, Hey.,male
BLAKE," That was you outside the stock exchange, right?",male
BLAKE, When? When half the city’s cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out.,male
BLAKE," Detective, now.",male
BLAKE, And as a detective...I’m not allowed to believe in coincidences anymore -,male
BLAKE, What were you doing?! What?!,male
BLAKE," Commissioner, I’m at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me - Commissioner, they’ve got Polyisobutylene here... (Looks around.) And motor oil. They weren’t making cement, they were making explosives -",male
BLAKE," Oh, God.",male
BLAKE, Patch me into Foley!,male
BLAKE, They’re heading into a trap!,male
BLAKE, It’s a trap! Pull everyone out! Bane’s been pouring concrete laced with explosives -,male
BLAKE, There’s a ring around the tunnels - they’re gonna blow it and trap the cops underground!,male
BLAKE, Foley?,male
BLAKE, Not every cop...,male
BLAKE, What does that mean?,male
BLAKE," Sir, they’ll kill you the second you show your face -",male
BLAKE, Bane’s not gonna let that happen -,male
BLAKE, And you’ll be dead.,male
BLAKE," We’re gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a camera -",male
BLAKE," These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.",male
BLAKE, Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for.,male
BLAKE," Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner.",male
BLAKE, For the bus in case there’s a chance to evacuate. Keep it in here - people are siphoning parked cars.,male
BLAKE, How do you think I got it?,male
BLAKE," Less you know, Father. How’re the boys?",male
BLAKE," Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you’ve got a hole big enough for ten at a time. I’m in contact with my partner - they’re waiting for the day.",male
BLAKE, Men with automatic weapons who haven’t seen daylight in three months.,male
BLAKE," While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state?",male
BLAKE, Aren’t you gonna tell him?!,male
BLAKE, I was up here looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here.,male
BLAKE," Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I’d like you to brief the Captain.",male
BLAKE, And here’s the important part.,male
BLAKE, The bomb’s a time bomb.,male
BLAKE, Bane’s revolution is a sham. He’s watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship’s going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought.,male
BLAKE," Fox, somebody sold us out!",male
BLAKE, You shouldn’t be out on the streets -,male
BLAKE, Heads up.,male
BLAKE, You missed a spot.,male
BLAKE, No one cares who I am.,male
BLAKE, Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that?,male
BLAKE," No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt?",male
BLAKE, But how do we -?,male
BLAKE, Okay.,male
BLAKE, What now?,male
BLAKE, Why?,male
BLAKE, Don’t you need me here?,male
BLAKE, Thank you.,male
BLAKE, I might not get a chance later.,male
BLAKE," Knock on doors, spread the word - the bomb’s going to blow! Get out by the South Street tunnel, or over the bridge! Do two blocks, then get back to the bus!",male
BLAKE," Blake, MCU - I’m getting these boys to safety -",male
BLAKE, It’s gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now.,male
BLAKE, Whose orders? Bane’s?,male
BLAKE, Haven’t you heard the shooting? The Batman’s battling it out with Bane -,male
BLAKE, It’s Detective -,male
BLAKE, Wait for me back at the bus.,male
BLAKE," Your orders are out of date! The situation’s changed! Listen, I’m a cop like you. And I’m walking out there. Please don’t shoot me.",male
BLAKE, You idiots! You sons of bitches! You’re killing us!!,male
BLAKE, Father! Get the boys on the bus -,male
BLAKE, Come on! On the bus!,male
BLAKE, Protection from the blast -,male
BLAKE, You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I’m going to let them die without hope?,male
BLAKE," Heads down! Heads down, now!",male
BLAKE, They’re children! They have no peace to make - Get down! This is it!,male
BLAKE, No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can’t take it. The injustice. (Gestures at gardens.) I mean...no one’s ever going to know who saved an entire city.,male
BLAKE," Blake, John.",male
BLAKE, Try my legal name.,male
GORDON, Let’s go see about the Congressman’s wife...,male
GORDON, Anything strange about the pourings?,male
GORDON," Clear the corners, rookie.",male
GORDON, They don’t have any choice.,male
STRYVER, You brought a date?,male
STRYVER, Very nice.,male
STRYVER," Oh, yes.",male
STRYVER, I count fine.,male
STRYVER," In fact, I’m counting to ten right now...",male
STRYVER," We can’t have loose ends. And even in that dress, no one’s going to miss you.",male
STRYVER, Cute. But they’re not gonna be looking in a place like this.,male
STRYVER, He’s drawing the cops off Bane...,male
STRYVER," Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished.",male
STRYVER," He says, and I quote, they would die before talking.",male
STRYVER, Nice outfit...those heels make it tough to walk?,male
STRYVER, Not that we know of -,male
STRYVER, We told him it was urgent -,male
STRYVER, I want to see Bane! There’s been a mistake! Take me to Bane!,male
STRYVER, There’s been a mistake! Where’s Bane?!,male
STRYVER, Call Bane! I’m one of you!,male
STRYVER, Exile.,male
STRYVER, Has anyone made it?,male
SELINA, I like having someone around to open doors for me.,female
SELINA, Right hand. No partials.,female
SELINA," Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me?",female
SELINA, I don’t know what you’re going to do with Mr. Wayne’s prints...but I’m guessing you’ll need his thumb.,female
SELINA," You don’t count so good, huh?",female
SELINA," Okay, okay -",female
SELINA, My friend is waiting outside. Just hit ’send’...,female
SELINA," It’ll liven up in a minute, trust me.",female
SELINA, Great. Catch you later.,female
SELINA, It would’ve been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed.,female
SELINA, No. But my friend over there...?,female
SELINA, Every cop in the city’s missing him.,female
SELINA, I don’t know... You did just use his cell phone.,female
SELINA," Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.",female
SELINA, There’s a man in there - he’s bleeding!,female
SELINA, Get out.,female
SELINA, Now.,female
SELINA," I told you not to try it with the assholes, Jen.",female
SELINA," Okay, the assholes who hit.",female
SELINA, Probably the watch.,female
SELINA, You were supposed to be a shut-in.,female
SELINA, Why didn’t you call the police?,female
SELINA, Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?,female
SELINA," His wife’s in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they’d get stolen.",female
SELINA, You think I care what anyone in this room thinks about me?,female
SELINA," Don’t condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don’t know a thing about me.",female
SELINA, You don’t get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.,female
SELINA, I started off doing what I had to. Once you’ve done what you had to they’ll never let you do what you want to.,female
SELINA, There’s no fresh start in today’s world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes.,female
SELINA, The mistakes stick better. Trust me.,female
SELINA, I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don’t stand on the shoulders of people with less.,female
SELINA, I’d do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.,female
SELINA, Or maybe you’re being unrealistic about what’s really in your pants other than your wallet.,female
SELINA, You think all this can last?,female
SELINA," There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you’re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.",female
SELINA, I’m adaptable.,female
SELINA, He’s not a mark.,female
SELINA," And he doesn’t have a cent to his name, anyway.",female
SELINA," Yeah, it’s not much. (Smiles.) But it’s more that you’ve got right now.",female
SELINA," The rich don’t even go broke same as the rest of us, huh?",female
SELINA, Let’s just say that I’ve incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you.,female
SELINA, And how would he do that?,female
SELINA, It doesn’t exist.,female
SELINA, Why?,female
SELINA, Tell him I’ll think about,female
SELINA, Mr. Wayne? I’m sorry they your money.,female
SELINA, Would you mind?,female
SELINA," Don’t tell me, still in love?",female
SELINA, Girl’s gonna eat.,female
SELINA, Maybe it’s not you I’m running from.,female
SELINA, That you should be as afraid of him as I am.,female
SELINA, I’m not sure.,female
SELINA," Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?",female
SELINA, This was someone’s home.,female
SELINA, No. It’s what I thought I wanted.,female
SELINA, You boys know you can’t come into my neighborhood without asking politely.,female
SELINA," Never steal anything from someone you can’t outrun, kid.",female
SELINA, Just tax.,female
SELINA, You came back. I thought they’d killed you.,female
SELINA, If you’re expecting an apology -,female
SELINA, And why would I help you?,female
SELINA, You’re gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you?,female
SELINA, Start fresh? I can’t even get off this island.,female
SELINA, Why do you need Fox?,female
SELINA, Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way.,female
SELINA, Get your powerful friend on the case.,female
BLAKE," We were so excited - Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. We made up stories about you. Legends. The other boys’ stories were just that. But when I saw you I knew  who you really were... (Beat.) I’d seen that look on your face. Same one I taught myself.",male
MIRANDA," Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr. Wayne was trying to do...",female
FOX, I’ll pass along your request. Next time I see him.,male
FOX, Let’s just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities.,male
FOX, I was not. But it wouldn’t do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority.,male
FOX, Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.,male
FOX, What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne?,male
FOX," Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive.",male
FOX," A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in.",male
FOX, If you’re not willing to turn your machine on -,male
FOX," Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm’s length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she’s supported your project all the way. She’s smart, and quite lovely.",male
FOX," We all just want what’s best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine.",male
FOX, Anything else?,male
FOX, These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests.,male
FOX," Let me show you some stuff, anyway.",male
FOX," It was always shut down, officially.",male
FOX," After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I’ve spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof.",male
FOX," Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them...",male
FOX, Sure I can’t tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg.,male
FOX," Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn’t like to walk...",male
FOX, Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation.,male
FOX," It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.",male
FOX, Works great except for the autopilot.,male
FOX, Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it.,male
FOX," I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps.",male
FOX, Answering your own door?,male
FOX, I didn’t need to. Page three.,male
FOX, It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night.,male
FOX," Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you’re completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.",male
FOX," Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story.",male
FOX, We’re meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed.,male
FOX," Bear with me, Miss Tate.",male
FOX, Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times.,male
FOX, The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.,male
FOX, I’m gonna plead the fifth on that one.,male
