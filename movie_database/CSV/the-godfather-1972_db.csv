0,BONASERA," I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her, like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was a'broken. Her jaw was a'shutted, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life ... beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again.",1,male

610,MICHAEL, Well he knows how grateful you are. That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you...,1,male
611,MICHAEL, The Corleone Family is thinking of giving up all its interests in the olive oil business - settling out here. Now Moe Greene will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel so it could be completely owned by the Family. Tom.,1,male
612,MICHAEL," Yeah well I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. See, Johnny...see we figure that entertainment will be a big factor in drawing gamblers to the casino.

617,MICHAEL, Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better...,1,male
618,MICHAEL, You're unlucky,1,male
619,MICHAEL, Wait a minute. You took Freddie in because the Corleone Family bankrolled your casino because the Molinari Family on the Coast guaranteed his safety. Now we're talking business. Let's talk business...,1,male

Ten years ago could I have gotten to him? Well now he's dead. He's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back.

211,SONNY," I'll get it. Yeah...Yeah...Well, thanks... Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.",1,male
212,SONNY, That's my man in McCluskey's precinct. A police captain's gotta be on call twenty- four hours a day. He signed out at that number between eight and ten. Anybody know this joint?,1,male
213,SONNY," Listen, I want somebody good and I mean very good...to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?",1,male

223,SONNY, What?,1,male
224,SONNY," Oh, Tom...",1,male
225,SONNY," No, Pop can't do nothin' til he's better! I'm going to decide what's going to be done.",1,male
226,SONNY, Whattsa matter?,1,male
227,SONNY, Well neither can they! Don't worry about it.,1,male
228,SONNY," Please, don't worry about it!",1,male
229,SONNY," Well, then, there ain't no more stalemate. I'm gonna end it by killin' that old bastard! I'm gonna... kill...",1,male

965,TATTAGLIA," But I must have strict assurance from Corleone as time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vendetta?",1,male
852,TESSIO," We'll need'em now. After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia 4 o'clock this morning.",1,male
853,TESSIO," Yeah, sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his business. It's perfect. Pete they got an old-fashion toilet...you know, the box, and... and... and... ah the chain-thing. We might be able to tape the gun behind it.",1,male
854,TESSIO," Forgive me, Godfather, but with you gone me and Pete'll come under Barzini's thumb sooner or later...",1,male
855,TESSIO, Alright...,1,male

862,TESSIO, Huh? Tom can you get me off the hook? For Ol' Times' sake?,1,male

270,TOM, Who should I give this job to?,1,male
271,TOM," He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you.",1,male
272,TOM," He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, so he wanted to thank you.",1,male
273,TOM, Mike!,1,male
274,TOM, Heh...! You look terrific!,1,male
275,TOM, How do you do.,1,male
276,TOM, Your father's been asking for you. Very nice to meet you.,1,male
277,TOM," Senator Cauly apologized for not coming personally...he said you'd understand. Also, some of the judges. They've all sent gifts. Salute!",1,male
278,TOM, It's been two years; he probably got into trouble again.,1,male
279,TOM, Sonny? Sonny?,1,male
280,TOM, Sonny? Sonny you in there?,1,male
281,TOM, Your old man wants to see you.,1,male
282,TOM," In a few minutes, right after they cut the cake. Now you're new son-in-law; give him something important?",1,male
283,TOM, Virgil Sollozzo called. Now we're gonna have to give him a day sometime next week.,1,male
284,TOM, When am I going to California?,1,male
285,TOM," Uh, I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane's. His friend is my client, who' d give his undying friendship to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz would grant us a small favor.",1,male
286,TOM, Give Johnny the part in that new war film you're starting next week.,1,male
287,TOM," You're gonna have some union problems; my client could make then disappear. Also, one of your top stars has just moved from ah marijuana to heroin...",1,male
288,TOM, Absolutely not.,1,male
289,TOM, I'm German-Irish...,1,male
290,TOM," Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer, I have not threatened you.",1,male
291,TOM," I have a special practice; I handle one client. Now you have my number; I'll wait for your call...by the way, I admire your pictures very much.",1,male
292,TOM, This is really beautiful.,1,male
293,TOM," Oh, yeah; very nice.",1,male
294,TOM, I don't like to use his name unless it's really necessary.,1,male
295,TOM, Fine.,1,male
296,TOM, He's beautiful.,1,male
297,TOM," Mr. Corleone is Johnny's godfather. To the Italian people, that's a very religious, sacred, close relationship.",1,male
298,TOM," He doesn't ask a second favor once he's been refused the first, understood?",1,male
299,TOM, Thank you for the dinner and a very pleasant evening. If your car could take me to the airport; Mr. Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news immediately.,1,male
300,TOM," No, no. I slept on the plane. I have the Sollozzo notes here. Now Sollozzo is known as 'The Turk.' He's supposed to be very good with a knife, but only in matters of business or some sort of reasonable complaint. Uh, his business is narcotics. He has fields in Turkey where they grow the poppy. And in Sicily he has the plants to process them into heroin. Now he needs cash, and he needs protection from the police, for which he gives a piece of the action...I couldn't find out how much. The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York. Now they have to be in it for something.",1,male
301,TOM," Two terms. One in Italy, one here. He's known as a top narcotics man.",1,male
302,TOM," Well, I say yes. There's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at. Now if we don't get into it, somebody else will. Maybe one of the Five Families, maybe all of them. Now with the money they earn, they can buy more police and political power; then they come after us. Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; an' they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. An' if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have...I mean not now, but ah ten years from now.",1,male
303,TOM," It's from ah Johnny, staring in that new, ah, film.",1,male
304,TOM, Take it over there.,1,male
305,TOM, Is there anything I can do for you?,1,male
306,TOM, Well I haven't got time,1,male
307,TOM, Sonny'll come after you with everything he's got.,1,male
308,TOM," I'll try, but even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.",1,male
309,TOM, I'll to my best.,1,male
310,TOM, Too much...,1,male
311,TOM, It's too far - I think it's too personal... The Don'll consider this all...,1,male
312,TOM," Sollozzo's the key. You get rid of him, every falls into line. Now what about Luca? Sollozzo thinks he's...",1,male
313,TOM, Has anyone been able to get in touch with Luca?,1,male
314,TOM, Luca never sleeps over with a broad - he always goes home when he's through...,1,male
315,TOM," If we lose the old man we lose our political contacts and half our strength. The other New York Families might wind up supporting Sollozzo just to avoid a long destructive war. This is almost 1946,",1,male
316,TOM, I'm as much a son to him as you or Mike.,1,male
317,TOM, Uh maybe we shouldn't get Mike uh mixed up in this too directly .,1,male
318,TOM," I'm attorney for the Corleone family. These men are private detectives hired to protect Vito Corleone. They're licensed to carry firearms. If you interfere, you'll have to appear before a judge in the morning and show cause.",1,male
319,TOM, Yeah?,1,male
320,TOM, What did he say?,1,male
321,TOM, What about Bruno Tattaglia?,1,male
322,TOM," Sonny, we ought to hear what they have to say...",1,male
323,TOM, Some of the other families won't sit still for all-out war!,1,male
324,TOM," You're father wouldn't want to hear this! This is business, not personal, Sonny !",1,male
325,TOM," Even the shooting of your father was business, not personal, Sonny!",1,male
326,TOM, I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw...,1,male
327,TOM," Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey has agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo is being guarded like this, he is invulnerable. Now nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain...never. It would be disastrous. All the Five Families would come after you, Sonny. The Corleone Family would be outcasts! Even the old man's political protection would run for cover! So do me a favor take this into consideration.",1,male
328,TOM, Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing. Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting's going to be held.,1,male
329,TOM, What about the negotiator?,1,male
330,TOM," There's too much of a risk for Mike. Maybe we outta call it off, Sonny.",1,male
331,TOM," Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny!",1,male
332,TOM, Well is it reliable?,1,male
333,TOM," Take care, Mike...",1,male
334,TOM," Since McCluskey's killing, the police have been cracking down on most of our operations - and also the other Families. There's been a lot of bad blood.",1,male
335,TOM," Through our contacts in the newspapers, we've been able to put out a lot of material about McCluskey being linked with Sollozzo in the drug rackets. See - things are starting to loosen up.",1,male
336,TOM, It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. But he's safe and we're starting to work to bring him back now.,1,male
337,TOM, Hey Sonny...,1,male
338,TOM, Things are starting to loosen up a little bit. If you go after Tattaglia all he ll's gonna break...,1,male
339,TOM, ... loose. Let...let the smoke clear. Pop can negotiate.,1,male
340,TOM," All right, but your war is costing us a lot of money; nothing's coming in!",1,male
341,TOM, We can't do business.,1,male
342,TOM, They don't have our over-head!,1,male
343,TOM, We can't afford a stalemate!,1,male
344,TOM," Yeah, well you're getting a great reputation! I hope you're enjoying it...",1,male
345,TOM, It's alright...,1,male
346,TOM," Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay you should call.",1,male
347,TOM," Nobody knows where he is. We know that he's alright, but that's all.",1,male
348,TOM," Well that's an accident, but nobody was hurt...",1,male
349,TOM," Well, if I accepted that in a court of law they could prove that I have knowledge of his whereabouts. Now you just be patient, Kay he'll get in touch with you, alright.",1,male
350,TOM," Come on, I'm sorry...come on.",1,male
351,TOM," Sonny! Sonny, come on...",1,male
352,TOM, Move out. Go on!,1,male
353,TOM," Ah, I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you just now and tell you...",1,male
354,TOM, Yup...,1,male
355,TOM, They shot Sonny on the Causeway. He's dead.,1,male
356,TOM," When I meet with the Tattaglia people, should I insist that all his drug middlemen have clean records?",1,male
357,TOM, You mean Tattaglia...,1,male
358,TOM," Mike, uh why am I out?",1,male
359,TOM, Maybe I could help...,1,male
360,TOM," Just a minute now - the Don is semi- retired and Mike is in charge of the Family business now. If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.",1,male
361,TOM, Do you know how they're gonna come at'cha?,1,male
362,TOM," I always thought it would've been Clemenza, not Tessio...",1,male
363,TOM, I'm sure he will...,1,male
364,TOM," I can't go either, Sal.",1,male
365,TOM, He understands that.,1,male
366,TOM," Can't do it, Sally.",1,male
791,TOM, Hello?,1,male
792,TOM, Yes...,1,male
793,TOM, Hello?,1,male
794,TOM," Hi, Mike, how are you?",1,male
795,TOM, Right...,1,male
796,TOM," Right, Mikey...",1,male
916,TOMMASINO," Michele, Why are you so far from the house? You know I'm responsible to your father for your life.",1,male
917,TOMMASINO, It's still dangerous. We've heard from Santino in New York. Your enemies know you're here.,1,male
918,TOMMASINO, Not yet. It's out of the question.,1,male
919,TOMMASINO, Where are you going now?,1,male
920,TOMMASINO, Take my car...,1,male
921,TOMMASINO, Accura! Be careful!,1,male
922,TOMMASINO," Young people don't respect anything anymore. Times are changing for the worse. This place has become too dangerous for you. I don't think you're safe here. I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa, right now...Subita, eh?",1,male
923,TOMMASINO," Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino, they killed him.",1,male
924,TOMMASINO, Morta.,1,male
939,VITELLI, Did you have a good hunt?,1,male
940,VITELLI," Ah, I understand...really put together...",1,male
941,VITELLI," Ah, he girls around here are beautiful but virtuous, ah?",1,male
942,VITELLI, NO! There's no girl like that in this town!,1,male
943,VITELLI, Who is this? He sounds American...,1,male
944,VITELLI, Come to my house Sunday. My name is Vitelli...,1,male
945,VITELLI, Apollonia.,1,male
946,VITELLI," E guesta mia figlia, Apollonia e guesto Michele Corleone.",1,male
947,VITELLI, What happened to your eye...,1,male
11,VITO, Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?,1,male
12,VITO, What is that?,1,male
13,VITO, That I cannot do.,1,male
14,VITO," We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you came to me for counsel, for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here: you never wanted my friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be in my debt.",1,male
15,VITO," I understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The police protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. But uh, now you come to me and you say ""Don Corleone give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you uh ask me to do murder, for money.",1,male
16,VITO, That is not justice; your daughter is still alive.,1,male
17,VITO," Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had you come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And that by chance if an honest man such as yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.",1,male
18,VITO," Good. Some day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But uh, until that day accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.",1,male
19,VITO," Prego. Ah, give this to ah, Clemenza. I want reliable people; people that aren't gonna be carried away. I'm mean, we're not murderers, despite of what this undertaker says.",1,male
20,VITO, Where's Michael?,1,male
21,VITO, We're not taking the picture without Michael,1,male
22,VITO," Eh, Don Barzini.",1,male
23,VITO," Nazorine, my friend, what can I do for you?",1,male
24,VITO," You want Enzo to stay in this country, and you want your daughter to be married .",1,male
25,VITO, Bene.,1,male
26,VITO," Not to our paisan. Give it to a jew congressman, in another district. Who else is on the list?",1,male
27,VITO, Is this...is this necessary?,1,male
28,VITO, All right.,1,male
29,VITO," Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend.",1,male
30,VITO, Thank you.,1,male
31,VITO, What is that outside?,1,male
32,VITO," I'll take care of it. Tom, I want you to find Santino. Tell him to come to the office.",1,male
33,VITO, What's his name?,1,male
34,VITO, You can act like a man! What's the matter with you? Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood...? That ah cries like a woman? What can I do?! What can I do?! What is that nonsense? Ridiculous.,1,male
35,VITO, You spend time with your family?,1,male
36,VITO," Good. 'Cause a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real m an. Come're. You look terrible. I want you to eat. I want you to rest a while. And in a month from now, this - Hollywood bigshot's gonna give you what you want.",1,male
37,VITO," I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Now you just go outside and enjoy yourself, and ah, forget about all this nonsense. I want you to leave it all to me.",1,male
38,VITO, Well...,1,male
39,VITO, What time does my daughter leave with the bridegroom?,1,male
40,VITO," Never. Give him a living, but never discuss the family business with him. What else?",1,male
41,VITO, We'll discuss it when you come back from California.,1,male
42,VITO," Want you to go tonight; I want you to talk to this movie bigshot, and settle this business for Johnny. Now, if there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding.",1,male
43,VITO," You're not too tired, are you, Tom?",1,male
44,VITO, What about his prison record?,1,male
45,VITO, Santino? Whattaya think?,1,male
46,VITO, Tom?,1,male
47,VITO, What is the interests for my family?,1,male
48,VITO, And what is the interest for the Tattaglia Family?,1,male
49,VITO," So I receive thirty percent for finance political influence, and legal protection, that's what your telling me?",1,male
50,VITO, Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve this generosity?,1,male
51,VITO," I said that I would see you because, I heard that you're a serious man, to be treated with respect. But uh, I must say no to you and I'll give you my reasons. It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics, but they wouldn't be friendly very long if they knew my business w as drugs instead of",1,male
52,VITO," It...makes...it doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living, understand. But your business is ah...a little dangerous.",1,male
53,VITO, Wait a minute...,1,male
54,VITO," I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them as you can see; they talk when they should listen. But, anyway, Signor Sollozzo, my no is final, and I wish to congratulate you on your new business, and I hope you do very well. And good luck to you...as best as your interests don't conflict with my interests. Thank you.",1,male
55,VITO," Santino, come're. Whattsa matter with you? I think your brain is going soft fro m all that comedy your playing with that young girl. Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again! Go on... Tom... What...what is this nonsense?",1,male
56,VITO," Ah...Well, take it away.",1,male
57,VITO," And uh, tell Luca Brasi to come in.",1,male
58,VITO," I'm a little worried about this Sollozzo fella. I want you to find out what he' s got under his fingernails, ya'know. Go to the ah Tattaglia's, and ah, make them think that ah you're...you're not too happy with our family and...and ah find out what you can.",1,male
59,VITO," Andiamo, Fredo. Tell Paulie to get the car; we're going.",1,male
60,VITO, Huh?!,1,male
61,VITO," Buon nateli, Dano. Grazie",1,male
62,VITO," Aspetta, Fredo; I'm gonna buy some fruit aspetta...wait.",1,male
63,VITO," Hi, merry Christmas; I wan some fruit over there. What is this? Gimme three. And that one...",1,male
64,VITO, Where's Michael? Where's Michael?,1,male
65,VITO," Give me a drop... My wife is crying upstairs. I hear cars coming to the house. Consiglieri of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone seems to know...",1,male
66,VITO, But you needed a drink first.,1,male
67,VITO," Well, now you've had your drink.",1,male
68,VITO," I want all inquiries made. I want no acts of vengeance. I want you to arrange a meeting, with the heads of the Five Families. This war stops now.",1,male
69,VITO, Call Bonasera. We need him now.,1,male
70,VITO," Well, my friend are you ready to do me this service?",1,male
71,VITO, I want you to use all your powers and all your skills. I don't want his mother to see him this way... Look how they massacred my boy...,1,male
72,VITO," Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this  meeting here today. And also the other heads of the Five Families, New York and New Jersey. Carmine Corleone from the Bronx and ah... Brooklyn...Philip Tattaglia.  An' from Staten Island, we have with us Victor Strachi. And all the other associates that came as far as from California, and Kansas City, and all the other territories of the country...thank you. How did things ever get so far? I don't know. It was so unfortunate...so unnecessary. Tattaglia lost a son and I lost a son. We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees, then I'm willing to let things go on the way they were before...",1,male
73,VITO," When...when did I ever refuse an accommodation? All of you know me here. When did I ever refuse? Except one time. And why? Because I believe this drug business is gonna destroy us in the years to come. I mean, it's not like gambling or liquor...even women, which is something that most people want nowadays, and is ah forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of the Church. Even the police departments that've helped us in the past with gambling and other things are gonna refuse to help us when in comes to narcotics. And I believed that then and I believe that now.",1,male
74,VITO, I hoped that we would come here and reason together. And as a reasonable man I'm willing to do whatever's necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems...,1,male
75,VITO," You talk about vengeance...is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I forgo the vengeance of my son But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son was forced to leave this country... Because of this Sollozzo business. All right ... and I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely - cleared of all these false charges. But I'm a superstitious man and if some unlucky accident should befall him...if he should get shot in the head by a police officer or if he should hang himself in his jail cell or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room. And that, I do not forgive. But that aside let me say that I swear on the souls of my grandchildren that I will not be the one to break the peace that we have made here today...",1,male
76,VITO, Mention it. Don't insist. Barzini is a man who'll know that without being told.,1,male
77,VITO, Tattaglia's a pimp...he never'a could've outfought Santino. But I didn't know until this day that it was Barzini all along...,1,male
78,VITO," Look at this tomatoes, peppers...all of this perfecto...",1,male
79,VITO, I swore that I would never break the peace.,1,male
80,VITO, It is a sign of weakness...,1,male
81,VITO," Well, we have a lot of time to talk about it now.",1,male
82,VITO," Well, Michael is now head of the Family, and if he gives his permission, then you have my blessing...",1,male
83,VITO, Do you have faith in my judgment?,1,male
84,VITO, Do I have your loyalty?,1,male
85,VITO," Then be a friend to Michael, and do as he says.",1,male
86,VITO," I'm happy for you, Carlo.",1,male
87,VITO," Tom I advise Michael. I never thought you were a bad Consiglieri. I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace. Michael has all my confidence, as...as you do. But uh there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen.",1,male
88,VITO," So Barzini will move against you first. He'll set up a meeting with someone that you absolutely trust...guaranteeing your safety. And at that meeting, you'll be assassinated. I like to drink wine more than I used to anyway, I'm drinking more...",1,male
89,VITO, I don't know your wife and children. Are you happy with them?,1,male
90,VITO, That's good. I hope you don't mind the way I...I keep going over this Barzini business...,1,male
91,VITO," It's an old habit. I spent my life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men. How's your boy?",1,male
92,VITO, You know he looks more like you every day.,1,male
93,VITO," Read the funny papers. Oh...well...eh, I want you to arrange to have a telephone man check all the calls that go in and out of here because...",1,male
94,VITO," Ya know, cuz it could be anyone...",1,male
95,VITO," Oh, that's right. I forgot.",1,male
96,VITO," I knew that Santino was going to have to go through all this. And Fredo...well... Fredo was...well. But I never...I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life, I don't apologize, to take care of my family. And I refused to be a fool dancing on the string, held by all those bigshots. I don't apologize that's my life but I thought that...that when it was your time that...that you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone, or something...",1,male
97,VITO," Well this wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time...",1,male
98,VITO, Uh... Now listen. Whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting - he's the traitor. Don't forget that.,1,male
99,VITO, Come're...come're...come're,1,male
100,VITO," Yeah over here...over here. Be careful, you're spilling it. You're spilling it... Anthony...com'ere...com'ere...com'ere... com'ere. There, that's right. We'll put it right there. Aie watch this. Come here. I'll show you something, come here. Now you stand there...",1,male
101,VITO, Oh no? That's a new trick. You run in there...run in there...,1,male
704,VITO, He came all the way from California to come to the wedding; I told you he was going to come.,1,male
705,VITO, He's a good godson.,1,male

746,WOLTZ," All right, start talking.",1,male
747,WOLTZ, Woltz is listening.,1,male
748,WOLTZ," And ah, what favor would ah your friend ah grant Mr. Woltz?",1,male
749,WOLTZ, Are you trying to muscle me?,1,male
750,WOLTZ," Now listen to me, you smooth-talking son- of-a-bitch! Let me lay it on the line for you and your boss, whoever he is. Johnny Fontane will never get that movie! I don't care how many daigo guinea WOP greaseball gumbahs come out of the woodwork!",1,male
751,WOLTZ," Well let me tell you something my Kraut Mick friend, I'm gonna make so much trouble for you, you won't know what hit you!",1,male
752,WOLTZ," I know almost every big lawyer in New York, who the hell are you?",1,male
753,WOLTZ, Check him out...,1,male
754,WOLTZ," Well, look at this. It used to decorate the palace of a king.",1,male
755,WOLTZ," Why didn't you say you worked for Corleone, Tom? I thought you were just some c heap two-bit hustler Johnny was running in trying to bluff me.",1,male
756,WOLTZ," How's your drink, Tom?",1,male
757,WOLTZ," Hey, come on over here with me; I wanna show you something really beautiful. You do appreciate beauty, don't you? There you are, $600,000 on four hooves. I bet a Russian Czar never paid that kind of dough for a single horse. Khartoum. Khartoum. I'm not gonna race him, though. I'm gonna put him out to stud.",1,male
758,WOLTZ," Thanks, Tony.",1,male
759,WOLTZ," Let's get something to eat, huh?",1,male
760,WOLTZ, I respect that; just tell him he should ask me anything else. But this is one favor I can't give him.,1,male
761,WOLTZ," You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. That part is perfect for him; it'll make him a big star. And I'm gonna run him out of the business, and let me tell you why. Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges. For five years we had her under training. Singing lessons; acting lessons, dancing lessons. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her. I was gonna make her a big star! And let me be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, and it's not all dollars and cents. She was beautiful; she was young, she was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I ever had, and I had'em all over the world! And then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive-oil voice, and guinea charm. And she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous! And",1,male

959,WOMAN, This is a friend of Carlo's - would you tell him that I can't make it tonight until later?,1,female
966,ZALUCHI, I also don't believe in drugs. For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business.,1,male
967,ZALUCHI," Somebody comes to them and says, ""I have powders; if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment we can make fifty thousand distributing."" So they can't resist. I want to control it as a business, to keep it respectable. I don't want it near schools. I don't want it sold to children! That's an infamia. In my city, we would keep the traffic in the dark people - the colored. They're animals anyway, so let them lose their souls...",1,male
