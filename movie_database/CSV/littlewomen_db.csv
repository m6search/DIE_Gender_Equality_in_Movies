526,AMY, Go get him. Laurie prepare the horses. We can catch him before he gets to the train.,1,female,True

924,AMY, I am the most sorry for it now. I’m so sorry.,1,female,True
925,AMY," Even if I had my own money, which I don’t, it would belong to my husband the minute we were married. If we had children they would belong to him not me. They would be his property.

364,AUNT MARCH," No, so you can live a better life than your poor mother has.",1,female,True
365,AUNT MARCH, It is possible to be right and foolish.,1,female,True
366,AUNT MARCH," Well, you’re not paid to think.",1,female,True
367,AUNT MARCH, Then read and don’t sneak around. I don’t like sneaks.,1,female,True
368,AUNT MARCH, Amy? Come here.,1,female,True
369,AUNT MARCH," Come, sit!",1,female,True
370,AUNT MARCH," You just keep being a proper young lady and see if it doesn’t. You are your family’s hope now.

So you must marry well and save your family.",1,female,True
371,AUNT MARCH, That Laurence boy was just here.,1,female,True
372,AUNT MARCH, What a disappointment he’s turned out to be. It must be the Italian in him.,1,female,True
373,AUNT MARCH," He’s gone, to London. Why? What do you need to discuss with him?",1,female,True
374,AUNT MARCH," Well, I hope you’re happy. Now that you’ve ruined your life, just like your Mother did by marrying your father.",1,female,True
375,AUNT MARCH, You are most welcome.,1,female,True
376,AUNT MARCH," Oh, oh, I don’t like to be... KISSED!",1,female,True
377,AUNT MARCH, You’ll be sorry when you’ve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure!,1,female,True
378,AUNT MARCH," I understood your meaning, my dear.",1,female,True
379,AUNT MARCH, I don’t miss a THING.,1,female,True
380,AUNT MARCH," I may not always be right, but I am NEVER wrong.",1,female,True
381,AUNT MARCH," AMY! I said, “These French women couldn’t lift a hairbrush.”",1,female,True
382,AUNT MARCH, And you shouldn’t go home until you and Fred Vaughn are properly engaged.,1,female,True
383,AUNT MARCH," Other than that, you’re right, precious few ways for women. That’s why you should heed me.",1,female,True
384,AUNT MARCH," I know you don’t care much about marriage now. I can’t say I blame you, but I intend to go to Europe one more time, and I need a companion. How would you like to be the person I take?",1,female,True
385,AUNT MARCH," If you are very good, one day this ring will belong to you.",1,female,True
386,AUNT MARCH, That’s all I wanted to say to you. You can go finish your...little painting.,1,female,True
387,AUNT MARCH," Thank goodness, here’s the only sane member of the family. I really can’t take any more of this.",1,female,True
759,BETH, I can’t dance.,1,female,True
760,BETH, I like your nose.,1,female,True
761,BETH, I don’t want to go but I wish I could hear all the music.,1,female,True
762,BETH," That’s what you want too, isn’t it Jo? To be a famous writer?",1,female,True

764,BETH," I only do that for us, I don’t need anyone else to hear it.",1,female,True
765,BETH, Joanna and I are very hungry.,1,female,True
766,BETH, Is this where you say that Father would want us to?,1,female,True

768,BETH, His daughter died? That’s so sad.,1,female,True
769,BETH, When will he come home?,1,female,True
770,BETH, I’m just glad that mother doesn’t make me go to that school with all those girls...,1,female,True

782,BETH, Why not?,1,female,True
783,BETH, You have pencil and paper. Sit here and write me something.,1,female,True
784,BETH, Why?,1,female,True

786,BETH, Your hair!,1,female,True
787,BETH," I think the deep purple is very fitting for Mr. Laurence, do you agree Amy?",1,female,True
788,BETH, I had to thank him somehow for allowing me to play the piano at his house all the time.,1,female,True
789,BETH, You all haven’t been to see the Hummel’s. We should go.,1,female,True
790,BETH, But I always go by myself and you haven’t been keeping up with your tasks...,1,female,True
791,BETH, But it’s been weeks.,1,female,True

185,JO, WHY?,1,female,True
186,JO, You will be bored of him in two years and we will be interesting forever.,1,female,True
187,JO, I just hate that you’re leaving me.,1,female,True
188,JO, I’d rather be a free spinster and paddle my own canoe. I can’t believe childhood is over.,1,female,True
189,JO, Europe? With you?,1,female,True
190,JO," Oh... I, that’s wonderful Amy.",1,female,True
191,JO," Meg married, Amy off to Europe, now that you’re a graduate, you’ll be off on a long holiday - I’m not good like Beth so I’m angry and restless.",1,female,True
192,JO, Why? Should we run off and join a pirate ship?,1,female,True
193,JO," No, Teddy -- please don’t.",1,female,True

197,JO, I can’t - I’ve tried it and failed.,1,female,True
198,JO, I can’t say “Yes” truly so I won’t say it at all.,1,female,True
199,JO," You’ll find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house. I wouldn’t. I’m homely and awkward and odd and you’d be ashamed of me and we would quarrel - we can’t help it even now! - I’d hate elegant society and you’d hate my scribbling and we would be unhappy and wish we hadn’t done it and everything will be horrid.",1,female,True
200,JO," Nothing more -- except that... I don’t believe I will ever marry. I’m happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up.",1,female,True

203,JO," I ruined our friendship with my temper, just as I ruin everything.",1,female,True

205,JO, He is?,1,female,True
206,JO, That’s good of him.,1,female,True
207,JO, Perhaps... perhaps I was too quick in turning him down.,1,female,True
208,JO," If he asked me again, I think I would say yes... Do you think he’ll ask me again?",1,female,True
209,JO, I know that I care more to be loved. I want to be loved.,1,female,True

232,JO," Dear Mr. Dashwood: Enclosed are the first few chapters of a piece I’ve only begun working on. It could suit as a story for young people, but I think it is probably quite boring. However, I’m sending it to you just in case it has something of value, though I doubt it.",1,female,True
233,JO, I thought she hated me.,1,female,True
234,JO, What about you and John?,1,female,True
235,JO," I should sell it, but I’d love to do something that would really make Aunt March turn in her grave.",1,female,True

242,JO, When did you become so wise?,1,female,True
243,JO, Coming! I’m starving!,1,female,True
244,JO, But I’m famished.,1,female,True

252,JO, Goodbye.,1,female,True
253,JO, What?! Why are you all looking at me like that?,1,female,True

258,JO, Because the neighbor married her sister!,1,female,True
259,JO, No one. She doesn’t marry either of them.,1,female,True
260,JO, She says the whole book that she doesn’t want to marry.,1,female,True
261,JO, It isn’t the right ending.,1,female,True
262,JO, I suppose marriage has always been an economic proposition. Even in fiction.,1,female,True
263,JO, It’s mercenary.,1,female,True
264,JO, Fine.,1,female,True
265,JO, Because -- because you are going away.,1,female,True

271,JO," Yes, but, but it’s my book.",1,female,True
272,JO, So I get nothing? If it fails?,1,female,True
273,JO, The copyright?,1,female,True
274,JO, Might that be worth something?,1,female,True
275,JO, I see. It seems like something I would want to own.,1,female,True
