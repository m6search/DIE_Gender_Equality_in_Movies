408,GRACE, Who’s got my goddamn cigarette?!,1,female,True
409,GRACE, Norm.  I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?,1,female,True
410,GRACE, Not bad.  You sound a little formal.,1,female,True
411,GRACE," Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don’t need you.  I need your brother. You know -- the PhD who trained three years for this mission.",1,female,True
412,GRACE, How much lab training have you had?  Ever run a gas chromatograph?,1,female,True
413,GRACE, Any actual lab work at all?,1,female,True
414,GRACE, You see?  You see?  They’re pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain. I’m going to Selfridge.,1,female,True
415,GRACE," Parker, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see you’re intentionally screwing us.",1,female,True
416,GRACE," I need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout.",1,female,True
417,GRACE, Lucky?  How is this in any way lucky?,1,female,True
418,GRACE, The last thing I need is another trigger happy asshole out there!,1,female,True
419,GRACE, That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.,1,female,True
420,GRACE, How much link time have you logged?,1,female,True
421,GRACE, Tell me you’re joking.,1,female,True
422,GRACE," So you just figured you’d come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went?  What was going through your head?",1,female,True
423,GRACE, Relax and let your mind go blank.  That shouldn’t be hard for you.,1,female,True

432,GRACE," -- you’re driving an avatar, now.  That means you’re in my world, got it?",1,female,True
433,GRACE," That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough.  All this -- -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much.  But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na’vi won’t even talk to us anymore.",1,female,True
434,GRACE," We have a new face. You’re fluent, you’ve studied the culture.  You’re non-threatening. The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good.",1,female,True
435,GRACE," We don’t.  They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us.",1,female,True
436,GRACE, Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.,1,female,True
437,GRACE," Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles.",1,female,True

451,GRACE, Shit.,1,female,True
452,GRACE, He’s not going to make it till morning.,1,female,True
453,GRACE," Come on back, kid, that’s it.",1,female,True
454,GRACE," Damn, you were dug in like a tick. Is the avatar safe?",1,female,True
455,GRACE, -- so the kid’s out there one night and he’s got the Queen Bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car keys. Unbelievable.,1,female,True
456,GRACE," For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you.  God help us all.",1,female,True
457,GRACE, He’s the clan leader -- -- but she’s the spiritual leader.  Like a shaman.,1,female,True

461,GRACE, Don’t do anything unusually stupid.,1,female,True
462,GRACE, I’m not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micro-manage this thing. We’re going up into the mountains.,1,female,True

464,GRACE, See these magnetic formations.  We’re getting close.,1,female,True
465,GRACE, Yup. We’re in the flux vortex.,1,female,True
466,GRACE," Jake, take number two, it’s the least glitchy.  Norm, I need you to operate Jake’s link.",1,female,True
467,GRACE," It’s not our choice, Norm.",1,female,True
468,GRACE, He can’t go far.,1,female,True
469,GRACE, Let’s get you in.,1,female,True
470,GRACE," No -- now, when it’s fresh.",1,female,True
471,GRACE," I See you, Neytiri Mo’at’ite.",1,female,True
472,GRACE, This isn’t just about eye-hand coordination out there.  You need to listen to what she says.  Try to see the forest through their eyes.,1,female,True
473,GRACE, You’re still losing weight.  Here --,1,female,True
474,GRACE, Other body.  You need to take care of this body.,1,female,True
475,GRACE," Jake, I’m serious -- you look like crap. You’re burning too hard.",1,female,True
476,GRACE," I’m telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time.",1,female,True
477,GRACE, Yeah -- you’re gonna go ride a banshee. Or die trying.,1,female,True
478,GRACE," And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine.  You’re getting in way too deep. Trust me, I learned the hard way.",1,female,True
479,GRACE, Neytiri’s sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school.  She was angry about the clear-cutting.,1,female,True
480,GRACE," One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they’d set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess they thought I could protect them.",1,female,True
481,GRACE, The troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse.,1,female,True
482,GRACE," They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in front of Neytiri.  Then shot the others. I got most of the kids out, before they shot me.",1,female,True
483,GRACE, Yeah.,1,female,True
484,GRACE, A scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion.  But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa’atenuk. Mother. That kind of pain reaches back through the link.,1,female,True
485,GRACE, It’s a job.  Learn what you can -- but don’t get attached.,1,female,True
486,GRACE," It’s not our world, Jake.  And we can’t stop what’s coming.",1,female,True
487,GRACE," The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator.  Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported.",1,female,True
488,GRACE, Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls. It’s their most sacred place.,1,female,True

490,GRACE, Watch that stuff.  It’ll knock you into next week.,1,female,True
491,GRACE," Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months.  But -- we need more time.",1,female,True
492,GRACE," Parker, it’s their ancestral home. They’ve lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks.",1,female,True
493,GRACE," Jake, I can’t allow this.  You’re just not strong enough.",1,female,True
494,GRACE, Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na’vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death.,1,female,True
495,GRACE, No matter what you prove out there-- you are still in here. Right here.,1,female,True
496,GRACE," Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them!",1,female,True
497,GRACE, Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain.  You visit -- and you leave.,1,female,True
498,GRACE, You can never truly be with her.,1,female,True
499,GRACE," And what about now, Jake?",1,female,True
500,GRACE, I know.,1,female,True

512,GRACE," Or what, Ranger Rick?  You gonna shoot me? You need to muzzle your dog!",1,female,True
513,GRACE," This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can’t imagine.",1,female,True
514,GRACE, I’m not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I’m talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest.,1,female,True
515,GRACE, I can’t do this.  How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate?,1,female,True
516,GRACE," Alright, look -- I don’t have the answers yet, I’m just now starting to even frame the questions.  What we think we know -- is that there’s some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees.  Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora --",1,female,True
517,GRACE, That’s more connections than the human brain. You get it? It’s a network -- a global network. And the Na’vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed.,1,female,True
518,GRACE," You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn’t in the ground -- it’s all around us. The Na’vi know that, and they’re fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.",1,female,True
519,GRACE," Parker, we have to talk, like rational people.",1,female,True
520,GRACE," They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. They’re fabricating this war to get what they want.",1,female,True
521,GRACE, My God.,1,female,True
522,GRACE," Parker, wait.  Stop! These are people you’re about to --",1,female,True
523,GRACE," For God’s sake, there are children in there.  Babies!",1,female,True
524,GRACE, They never wanted us to succeed.,1,female,True
525,GRACE, I’m free.,1,female,True
526,GRACE, Do what he goddamn says!,1,female,True
527,GRACE," Aaahh, crap. Not again.",1,female,True
528,GRACE, This is gonna ruin my whole day.,1,female,True
529,GRACE," Forget it, it doesn’t matter.",1,female,True
530,GRACE, I need to take some samples.,1,female,True
531,GRACE," I -- always held back.  But you gave them your heart. I’m proud of you, Jake.",1,female,True
532,GRACE, Help them.  You do whatever it takes. You hear me?,1,female,True
533,GRACE, I’m with her Jake -- -- she’s real --,1,female,True
573,GRACE, Hey Marine!,1,female,True
574,GRACE," The kids were so bright, so eager to learn... they picked up English faster than I could teach it to them.",1,female,True
750,GRACE, There’s a mobile link up at Site 26 that we can work out of.,1,female,True
751,GRACE, And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm- - we have no idea what that’ll do in an avatar brain.,1,female,True
2,JAKE," They can fix a spinal, if you’ve got the money.  But not on vet benefits, not in this economy.",1,male,True
3,JAKE, I became a Marine for the hardship.  To be hammered on the anvil of life.  I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass.,1,male,True
4,JAKE, Let’s get it straight up front.  I don’t want your pity.  I know the world’s a cold-ass bitch.,1,male,True
5,JAKE," You want a fair deal, you’re on the wrong planet.  The strong prey on the weak.",1,male,True
6,JAKE, It’s just the way things are.  And nobody does a damn thing.,1,male,True
7,JAKE, All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.,1,male,True
8,JAKE," The strong prey on the weak.  A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet.",1,male,True
9,JAKE, The Suits’ concern was touching.,1,male,True
10,JAKE," The egghead and the jarhead. the scientist, not me.  He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers.",1,male,True
11,JAKE, Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin’ sent someplace I was gonna regret.,1,male,True
12,JAKE, Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.,1,male,True
13,JAKE, The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar --,1,male,True
14,JAKE," Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace explained it to me -- some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor, or something.  At least somebody understands it.  Just not me.",1,male,True
15,JAKE, Neytiri thinks I’m some kind of retard.,1,male,True
16,JAKE, Norm’s attitude has improved lately.,1,male,True
17,JAKE," It’s good he’s back on board, but he thinks I’m a retard too.",1,male,True
18,JAKE, My feet are getting tougher.  I can run farther every day.,1,male,True
19,JAKE, I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it’s learn fast or die.,1,male,True
20,JAKE, I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass.  Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning.,1,male,True
21,JAKE," I’m learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.",1,male,True
22,JAKE, Sometimes I have no idea what she’s talking about.,1,male,True
23,JAKE, It’s been a month and I’m still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn’t given permission.,1,male,True
24,JAKE, There’s a lot of crap like that. She’s always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not --,1,male,True
25,JAKE," Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.",1,male,True
26,JAKE, Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven.  It’s the test every young hunter has to pass.,1,male,True
27,JAKE, I may not be much of a horse guy.  But I was born to do this.,1,male,True
28,JAKE, It’s hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest.,1,male,True
29,JAKE, They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed--,1,male,True
30,JAKE, -- and one day you have to give it back.,1,male,True
31,JAKE, Hard to believe it’s only been three months.,1,male,True
32,JAKE," I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.  Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up...",1,male,True
33,JAKE, The Well of Souls.  The heart of the forest.  I knew the People would go there.,1,male,True
34,JAKE," Outcast.  Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules.",1,male,True
35,JAKE, Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.,1,male,True
36,JAKE," The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.  Nothing attacks him.  So why would he ever look up?",1,male,True
37,JAKE, But that was just a theory.,1,male,True
38,JAKE," We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains.  When Toruk Macto called them, they came.",1,male,True
39,JAKE, I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.  But there was only one thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.,1,male,True
40,JAKE, A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.,1,male,True
41,JAKE," The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world.",1,male,True
42,JAKE, This is my last videolog.,1,male,True
43,JAKE," I better wrap this up. There’s a funeral tonight, and I don’t want to be late. It was someone very close to me.",1,male,True
44,JAKE, I hope you realize you’ve just lost a customer!,1,male,True
45,JAKE, Candy ass bitch.,1,male,True
46,JAKE, If it ain’t rainin’ we ain’t trainin’!,1,male,True

49,JAKE, Are we there?,1,male,True
50,JAKE, What’re you two limpdicks starin’ at?,1,male,True
51,JAKE, Yeah.,1,male,True
52,JAKE, That’s why I’m here.,1,male,True
53,JAKE, Damn.  They got big.,1,male,True
54,JAKE, It looks like him.,1,male,True
55,JAKE," -- so their nervous systems are in tune. Or something.  Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommy’s avatar, which was insanely expensive. Is this right?  I just say whatever in these videologs?",1,male,True
56,JAKE," Right. So, whatever.  Here I am.  Doing science. Never been in a lab before.",1,male,True
57,JAKE, He’s dead.  I know it’s a big inconvenience to everyone.,1,male,True
58,JAKE, No.,1,male,True
59,JAKE, High school chemistry.  But I ditched.,1,male,True
60,JAKE, Like -- an hour.,1,male,True

63,JAKE, Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --,1,male,True
64,JAKE, Grace?,1,male,True
65,JAKE, That’s kinda freaky.,1,male,True

67,JAKE," Yeah, no problem.",1,male,True
68,JAKE, I figured -- just another hellhole.,1,male,True
69,JAKE," That sounds real good, Colonel.  So -- am I still with Augustine?",1,male,True
70,JAKE, Just Marines comparin’ tattoos.,1,male,True
71,JAKE, Got it.,1,male,True
72,JAKE, Then how’s this supposed to work?,1,male,True
73,JAKE, How do we contact them?,1,male,True
74,JAKE, Or they may skin us and make a drum.,1,male,True
75,JAKE, What happened here?,1,male,True
76,JAKE, It’s already pissed off!,1,male,True
77,JAKE, What do I do?,1,male,True

92,JAKE," If I’m so ignorant, maybe you should teach me.",1,male,True
