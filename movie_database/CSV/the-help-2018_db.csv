915,CHARLOTTE," Eugenia, I've made a decision. Now my health's been on the uptick these past few weeks.",female
916,CHARLOTTE, And I know the doctor says it's some kind of last strength nonsense.  But- -I have decided not to die.,female

918,CHARLOTTE, I have never been more proud of you.,female

472,HILLY, They'd be a fool not to hire you.,female
473,HILLY, I'm so sorry.,female
474,HILLY," She can't take a hint, can she?",female
475,HILLY, That tacky girl Johnny married. From Sugar Ditch!,female
476,HILLY," And live thirty minutes outside of town?  No, thank you.  Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the Children's Benefit Ball.",female
477,HILLY," Yes, but we're not telling her.",female
478,HILLY, I'm fine.,female
479,HILLY," If Aibileen uses the guest bath, I'm sure she uses yours too.",female
480,HILLY, Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside?,female
481,HILLY," Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous.  They carry different diseases than we do.",female
482,HILLY, That's why I've drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative.,female
483,HILLY, A disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. It's been endorsed by the White Citizen's Council.,female
484,HILLY, You ought not to joke about the colored situation.,female
485,HILLY," I'll do whatever it takes to protect our children.  Your lead, Elizabeth.",female

493,HILLY," Get off of my toilet! You are fired, Minny Jackson!",female
494,HILLY, Go on!,female
495,HILLY, Okay. Go on.,female
496,HILLY," That's not working for free, Yule May.  That's paying off a debt.",female
497,HILLY," As a Christian, I'm doin' you a favor.",female
498,HILLY, God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able.  You need to come up with this money on your own. 'Kay?,female
499,HILLY, You'll thank me one day.,female
500,HILLY," We're running behind on our ""coat drive,"" girls. Hurry up and clean out those closets. Our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule.",female
501,HILLY, Think we can put a dent in African Children's hunger this year?!,female
502,HILLY," Now, I just found out the Surgeon General has reviewed The Home Health Sanitation Initiative that I drafted.",female
503,HILLY, And he just passed it along to Governor Barnett!,female

507,HILLY," Oh, it's fine.",female
508,HILLY," He's coming!  Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely coming this time.  Next Saturday week.",female
509,HILLY," Damnit, Skeeter, I'm not going to let you miss out on this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him.",female
510,HILLY," Stuart, she'll be here any minute.",female
511,HILLY, Skeeter!,female
512,HILLY," Boys, we'll be right back.  Y'all talk about quarterbacks or something.  Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.",female
513,HILLY," Honey, there's the Lieutenant Governor.",female
514,HILLY, Who is hungry?,female
515,HILLY," And just, doesn't she look glowing, everybody?  Yes, she does!",female
516,HILLY," Honey, you hold on to it to the bitter end, you hear, now?",female
517,HILLY," Well, congratulations.",female
518,HILLY," Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's?",female
519,HILLY," Nice to have your own, isn't it, Aibileen?",female
520,HILLY," Separate but equal.  That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the governor.",female
521,HILLY," What do you ""understand"", Skeeter?",female
522,HILLY, Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money?,female
523,HILLY," Skeeter, are you intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter?",female
524,HILLY," I know.  I know, you must be so worried about your mother, but, um...",female
525,HILLY," ...I'm worried about you. Readin' this stuff?  Believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with anything like that you'd be in serious trouble.",female
526,HILLY, Put my initiative in the newsletter. 'Kay?,female
527,HILLY, You're trespassing!,female
528,HILLY, Skeeter!  She put it in the newsletter.,female
529,HILLY, I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house.  Not commodes!,female
530,HILLY, Why would she do this to me?,female
531,HILLY, It's so... embarrassing.,female
532,HILLY, ... A nigra walks into a pawn shop with a ring of such size and color? It took them all of ten minutes to find out where she worked.,female
533,HILLY, I am desperate for a grilled cheese sandwich.,female
534,HILLY," I know, but I think we're on track. I think we're doing quite well.",female
535,HILLY, Who's there?,female
536,HILLY," Everybody hide.  Everybody get down, get down.",female
537,HILLY," So.  Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthin', thievin' nigra, did they?",female
538,HILLY," Pie's as good as always, Minny.",female
539,HILLY," If...I take you back, I'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week.",female
540,HILLY, What do you put in here that makes it taste so good?,female
541,HILLY, Momma can have a piece.,female
542,HILLY, Cut her one!  Go get a plate!,female
543,HILLY, What did you say?,female
544,HILLY, Have you lost your mind?,female
545,HILLY, Did what?,female
546,HILLY," Thanks, Jolene.  And I am so excited about the auction tonight, aren't you?",female
547,HILLY, Everybody enjoying the evening?,female
548,HILLY, Let's give a nice round of applause for the help.  For all the men and women that have helped make tonight possible.,female
549,HILLY," A cause I'm sure is dear to their hearts, as well.",female
550,HILLY, That's funny.  I didn't bid on anything.,female
551,HILLY," Come here, sweetheart, let me bring you back to your table.",female
552,HILLY, It's all right.  Don't worry about it.,female
553,HILLY, What are you trying to do to me? What are you and that nigra up to?,female
554,HILLY, You liar!  Who did you tell?!,female
555,HILLY," Shut up, Mother!",female
556,HILLY, Oh! Johnny would never cheat on me.,female
557,HILLY," You tell that nigra if she tells anybody, I will make her suffer!",female
558,HILLY," Just come on home with us tonight, Mother.",female
559,HILLY, You throw that pie away right now!,female
560,HILLY, You signed me up?,female
561,HILLY," Okay, Momma!  I need to run.",female
562,HILLY, What book?,female
563,HILLY," It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage.  I bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra.",female
564,HILLY, The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON!,female
565,HILLY," I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie Goodman.",female
566,HILLY," Oh, I one-hundred-percent know you wrote it 'cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you.",female
567,HILLY," I don't, do I?  You tell Aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh- huh.  Remember her?  Had you in her wedding?  Let's just say, Aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before puttin' in about that L-shaped scratch in poor Elizabeth's dining table.  And that nigger, Minny?  Do I have plans for her.",female
568,HILLY, That was not me!,female
569,HILLY, I've come to tell your mother what a hippie you've become.  She's gonna be disgusted by you.,female
570,HILLY," Oh, Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-",female
571,HILLY," No, ma'am.",female
572,HILLY," Well, I...I didn't have time to get fixed up--",female
573,HILLY," Missus Phelan, I came here--",female
574,HILLY," Aibileen, the silver I lent Elizabeth last week.",female
575,HILLY," When you returned it, three pieces were missing from the felt wrapper. A fork and two spoons.",female
576,HILLY, You know as well as I do that silver's not in the kitchen.,female
577,HILLY," Do you hear her, Elizabeth?  She's trying to blame it on a toddler.",female
578,HILLY," Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired, Aibileen.  And I'll be calling the police.",female
579,HILLY, Elizabeth can take care of her own children.,female
580,HILLY," Maybe I can't send you to jail for what you wrote, but I can send you for being a thief.",female
581,HILLY, Nobody would believe what you wrote.,female
582,HILLY," Call the police, Elizabeth.",female
831,JOHNNY, What's for lunch?,male
832,JOHNNY, Mm.  It's lunchtime and I'm suddenly hungry.,male
833,JOHNNY," Honey, don't you think you've had enough to drink? I wish you'd try and eat something.",male

839,JOHNNY," Listen, Celia finally told me about the babies.  All of 'em. But I also know that the minute you started working here, she started getting better.  So you saved her life.",male
840,JOHNNY, Fried chicken and okra on the first night?  Y'all should have at least put corn pone on the table.,male
841,JOHNNY," Well, thanks to you, now I've had to let out every pair of pants I own.",male

924,MISS STEIN, Really?,female
925,MISS STEIN, Well...I guess I can read what you come up with.  The book biz could use a little rattling.,female
926,MISS STEIN," Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying is that I'll let you know if it's even worth pursuing.  And for God's sake, you're a twenty-three year-old educated woman. Go get yourself an apartment.",female
927,MISS STEIN," I like this ""Sarah Ross.""  She testifies without complaining too much.",female
928,MISS STEIN," And that ""Bertha""...she's got chutzpah.  I'll give her that.",female
929,MISS STEIN," Eugenia, Martin Luther King just invited the country to march with him in D.C. in August. This many Negroes and whites haven't worked together since Gone with the Wind. How many stories have you recorded thus far?",female
930,MISS STEIN, Two domestics?!  That all?,female
931,MISS STEIN, Don't send me anything more until you do have more maids.,female
932,MISS STEIN," I don't know.  At least a dozen. And my advice is to write it and write it fast before this whole civil rights thing blows over.  Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.",female
933,MISS STEIN," I leave early this week for Thanksgiving and then our last editor's meeting is December 17th. If you want a prayer of this getting read, I need it by then.",female
934,MISS STEIN, Otherwise it goes in The Pile.,female

737,MISSUS WALTERS," Are we in Biloxi, Minny?",female
738,MISSUS WALTERS," You go on ahead and use the inside bath, Minny.  It's all right.",female

749,MISSUS WALTERS, I may have trouble remembering my own name or what country I live in. But there's two things I can't seem to forget:  That my own daughter threw me into a nursing home...and that she ate Minny's shit.  Good night.,female
750,MISSUS WALTERS," Hey, how about a nightcap?",female
751,MISSUS WALTERS," ""She fired me for using the inside toilet.  Put me out in a storm and told me never to come back.  But I did come back.",female
752,MISSUS WALTERS," Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly. Filled with grippin' testimonials from Mississippi's housekeepers.",female
753,MISSUS WALTERS," You should read the book, Hilly. It's quite scandalous. It sounds like Jackson, if you ask me.",female

359,SKEETER," You know, Aibileen, you don't have to call me ""ma'am.""  Not here.",female

383,SKEETER," Just water, please.",female
384,SKEETER, You sure you don't want to just make it the whole bottle and a straw?,female
385,SKEETER, I write... But right now I am writing a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal.,female
386,SKEETER," Well, I can.  Working with a bunch of greasy, stinky men in the middle of the ocean.",female
387,SKEETER," Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme.",female
388,SKEETER," I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant?  Or were you just born stupid?",female

396,SKEETER, It wouldn't be real.,female
397,SKEETER," You know she can hear you, Elizabeth?",female
398,SKEETER," Well, certainly not in Mississippi. Birthplace of modern day government.",female
399,SKEETER," No, thanks.  Yule May, I wanted to talk to you about something.",female

404,SKEETER," Well, I'll be on the lookout.",female
405,SKEETER, What?!,female
406,SKEETER, What's wrong?,female
407,SKEETER," Oh, God.  Oh, mother, you would not like him.  Trust me.  He's a drunken asshole.",female
