WILLIAM," Of course, I've seen her films and always thought she was, well, fabulous -- but, you know, million miles from the world I live in. Which is here -- Notting Hill -- not a bad place to be...",male
WILLIAM," There's the market on weekdays, selling every fruit and vegetable known to man...",male
WILLIAM, The tattoo parlor -- with a guy outside who got drunk and now can't remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...,male
WILLIAM," The racial hair-dressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or not...",male
WILLIAM," Then suddenly it's the weekend, and from break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate...",male
WILLIAM," ... and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine...",male
WILLIAM, ... and some not so genuine.,male
WILLIAM," And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London -- that's Tony, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant...",male
WILLIAM," So this is where I spend my days and years -- in this small village in the middle of a city -- in a house with a blue door that my wife and I bought together... before she left me for a man who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer...",male
WILLIAM, ... and where I now lead a strange half-life with a lodger called...,male
WILLIAM," And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as I set off through the market to work, little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever.  This is work, by the way, my little travel book shop...",male
WILLIAM," ... which, well, sells travel books -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those.",male
WILLIAM, Spike!,male
WILLIAM," This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?",male
WILLIAM, What are the choices?,male
WILLIAM, Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.,male
WILLIAM, Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.,male
WILLIAM," Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.",male
WILLIAM, Good luck.,male
WILLIAM, Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus 347 pound.,male
WILLIAM," Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.",male
WILLIAM, Can I help you?,male
WILLIAM, Fine.,male
WILLIAM," That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.",male
WILLIAM, Yes.  This one though is... very good.,male
WILLIAM," I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.",male
WILLIAM, If you could just give me a second.,male
WILLIAM, Excuse me.,male
WILLIAM, Bad news.,male
WILLIAM, We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.,male
WILLIAM," So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.",male
WILLIAM, The one down your trousers.,male
WILLIAM," Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what --I'll call the police -- and, what can I say?  If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.",male
WILLIAM," Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.",male
WILLIAM, Sorry about that...,male
WILLIAM," Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy.  It's worth an absolute fortune.",male
WILLIAM, Oh -- right -- on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad. Actually -- it's a sort of masterpiece really. None of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days.  And I'll throw in one of these for free.,male
WILLIAM," Very useful for fighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things.",male
WILLIAM, Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.,male
WILLIAM, No. No-one -- no-one.,male
WILLIAM, Topol.,male
WILLIAM, But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.,male
WILLIAM, So it would have been neither of them?,male
WILLIAM," Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?",male
WILLIAM, Right -- want another one?,male
WILLIAM," Here, let me help.",male
WILLIAM," Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.",male
WILLIAM, I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non- prostitute sense obviously.,male
WILLIAM, Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.,male
WILLIAM, Come on in.  I'll just...,male
WILLIAM," It's not that tidy, I fear.",male
WILLIAM, The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there.,male
WILLIAM, Would you like a cup of tea before you go?,male
WILLIAM, Coffee?,male
WILLIAM, Orange juice -- probably not.,male
WILLIAM," Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?",male
WILLIAM," Would you like something to nibble --apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.",male
WILLIAM, Do you always say 'no' to everything?,male
WILLIAM," You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.",male
WILLIAM," Take my one chance to say it.  After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop.",male
WILLIAM, Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.,male
WILLIAM, Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.,male
WILLIAM, 'Surreal but nice.'  What was I thinking?,male
WILLIAM, Coming.,male
WILLIAM, Oh hi.  Forgot something?,male
WILLIAM, Oh right.,male
WILLIAM, Here we go.,male
WILLIAM, I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...,male
WILLIAM, Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --there's no excuse for him.,male
WILLIAM, Hi.,male
WILLIAM," Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.",male
WILLIAM, It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.,male
WILLIAM," Yes, she is fairly fabulous.",male
WILLIAM," No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only sell travel books.",male
WILLIAM," No, that's a novel too.",male
WILLIAM, Martin -- your customer.,male
WILLIAM, Hi...,male
WILLIAM, Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?,male
WILLIAM," There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.",male
WILLIAM," No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.",male
WILLIAM, So -- any messages?,male
WILLIAM, Two?  That's it?,male
WILLIAM, Who were the ones you didn't write down from?,male
WILLIAM, Right.  No one else?,male
WILLIAM, What did she say?,male
WILLIAM, Which one?,male
WILLIAM, Hello.,male
WILLIAM," Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...",male
WILLIAM," No, that's right -- I know that. She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.",male
WILLIAM, Imagine if you will the stupidest person you've ever met -- are you doing that...?,male
WILLIAM, And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...,male
WILLIAM, What?,male
WILLIAM, Does 'Flinstone' mean anything to you?,male
WILLIAM, Oh my God.,male
WILLIAM, Hello.  Hi.  Hi.,male
WILLIAM," Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.",male
WILLIAM," No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.",male
WILLIAM, Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?,male
WILLIAM, Right.  Great. Classic.  Classic.,male
WILLIAM, Which floor?,male
WILLIAM, Are you sure you...?,male
WILLIAM, Oh.  Right.,male
WILLIAM, I agree.,male
WILLIAM, 'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.,male
WILLIAM, No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.,male
WILLIAM, Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.,male
WILLIAM, Hi.,male
WILLIAM," I brought these, but clearly...",male
WILLIAM, Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.,male
WILLIAM," So I'll just fire away, shall I?",male
WILLIAM, Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?,male
WILLIAM, Obviously.  Very difficult.,male
WILLIAM, I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I don't know what to do.,male
WILLIAM, Absolutely fine about it.,male
WILLIAM," Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our readers are equally intrigued by both species.",male
WILLIAM," Yes.  Right... But if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing?",male
WILLIAM," I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.",male
WILLIAM," Well, I suppose in the dream scenario. I just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen.",male
WILLIAM, Very neatly.,male
WILLIAM, Right.,male
WILLIAM, Are you busy tonight?,male
WILLIAM, Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.,male
WILLIAM, Fabulous.,male
WILLIAM, Yes.  That's right.  Bitch.,male
WILLIAM, The others?,male
WILLIAM," Ah... yes, enormously.",male
WILLIAM," Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?",male
WILLIAM, Any bit in particular?,male
WILLIAM," Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making that bit?",male
WILLIAM, Did you identify with the character you were playing?,male
WILLIAM, Ah.  Why not?,male
WILLIAM, Classic.,male
WILLIAM, Is this your first film?,male
WILLIAM, Of course it is.  Any favorite among the 22?,male
WILLIAM, Da Vinci?,male
WILLIAM, Of course.  And is he your favorite Italian film director?,male
WILLIAM, Yes?,male
WILLIAM," Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.",male
WILLIAM," But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.",male
WILLIAM, You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party.,male
WILLIAM," I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.",male
WILLIAM, Okay.,male
WILLIAM, He's cooking guinea fowl?,male
WILLIAM, Bella -- this is Anna.,male
WILLIAM, Max.  This is Anna.,male
WILLIAM, Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.,male
WILLIAM," That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.",male
WILLIAM," No, it doesn't.",male
WILLIAM, Definitely no comment.,male
WILLIAM, Bernie.,male
WILLIAM, Bella.,male
WILLIAM, So I get the brownie?,male
WILLIAM, You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.,male
WILLIAM, Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.,male
WILLIAM, Sorry -- they always do that when I leave the house.,male
WILLIAM, It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.,male
WILLIAM, It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.,male
WILLIAM," You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.",male
WILLIAM, Would you like to come... my house is just...?,male
WILLIAM, That's fine.,male
WILLIAM, I thought you were leaving.,male
WILLIAM, Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little village.,male
WILLIAM, Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.,male
WILLIAM, Ahm...,male
WILLIAM, Heck no -- other people do -- but not me -- I just do what I want.,male
WILLIAM, Whoopsidaisies.,male
WILLIAM, Nothing.,male
WILLIAM," No, I didn't.",male
WILLIAM," I don't think so.  No one has said ""whoopsidaisies,"" do they -- I mean unless they're...",male
WILLIAM, Exactly.  Here we go again.,male
WILLIAM, Whoopsidaisies.,male
WILLIAM," It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing, I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.",male
WILLIAM, Actually be careful Anna -- it's harder than it looks...,male
WILLIAM, Oh no it's not -- it's easy.,male
WILLIAM, Now seriously -- what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile?,male
WILLIAM, Nice garden.,male
WILLIAM," Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?",male
WILLIAM," Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.",male
WILLIAM," Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.",male
WILLIAM, Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.,male
WILLIAM, Sort of.,male
WILLIAM, She left me.,male
WILLIAM, She saw through me.,male
WILLIAM," Right, that's it.",male
WILLIAM, I'm sorry to disturb you guys but --,male
WILLIAM," Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard your conversation -- but I did and I just think, you know...",male
WILLIAM," ...the person you're talking about is a real person and I think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her...",male
WILLIAM, I'm sorry.,male
WILLIAM," No, you were brilliant",male
WILLIAM," I don't know, I'm afraid.",male
WILLIAM, There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.,male
WILLIAM, Hi.,male
WILLIAM, To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.,male
WILLIAM, Why?,male
WILLIAM, Your boyfriend?,male
WILLIAM, Ahm... room service.,male
WILLIAM," Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.",male
WILLIAM, I'll see what I can do.,male
WILLIAM, Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.,male
WILLIAM," No, I'm sure it'll be fine.",male
WILLIAM, Right.,male
WILLIAM, Ah -- no.  It's fine.,male
WILLIAM, Ahm... Bernie.,male
WILLIAM, I better leave.,male
WILLIAM," -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...",male
WILLIAM, I think good bye is traditional.,male
WILLIAM," Well, okay.  There's this girl...",male
WILLIAM, She's someone I just can't -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.,male
WILLIAM, Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful.,male
WILLIAM, No -- did you?,male
WILLIAM," Bloody hell, I can't believe it --my whole life ruined because I don't read ""Hello"" magazine.",male
WILLIAM, Buggered?,male
WILLIAM, Really?,male
WILLIAM, Has he?,male
WILLIAM, And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?,male
WILLIAM, Right.  Right.  Interesting stuff. So these carrots...,male
WILLIAM, Murdered?  Poor carrots.  How beastly.,male
WILLIAM, Interesting means inedible.,male
WILLIAM, Yes.  That would be...great.,male
WILLIAM," She's perfect, perfect.",male
WILLIAM," I think you have forgotten... ...what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always minuscule. Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.",male
WILLIAM," No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.",male
WILLIAM, In a depressingly asexual way.,male
WILLIAM," Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.",male
WILLIAM, Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.,male
WILLIAM, Come in.,male
WILLIAM, This is the place.,male
WILLIAM, Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?,male
WILLIAM," No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?",male
WILLIAM," Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.",male
WILLIAM, Oh no no -- no.,male
WILLIAM, I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?,male
WILLIAM, Would you like me to take you through your lines?,male
WILLIAM, Hand it over.  Basic plot?,male
WILLIAM, Well done you.,male
WILLIAM, 'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?',male
WILLIAM," 'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'",male
WILLIAM, Eleven.,male
WILLIAM, Cartwright.,male
WILLIAM, 'Certainly.  And little Johnny?',male
WILLIAM, Yup.,male
WILLIAM, Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.,male
WILLIAM," Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's Not Henry James, but it's gripping.",male
WILLIAM," I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.",male
WILLIAM, And I think the book is the poorer for it.,male
WILLIAM, You like Chagall?,male
WILLIAM, With a goat playing a violin.,male
WILLIAM," I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?",male
WILLIAM, Yes.  Always have had.,male
WILLIAM, No.  What's that?,male
WILLIAM, You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity.,male
WILLIAM, You have a stunt bottom?,male
WILLIAM, Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?,male
WILLIAM, It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.,male
WILLIAM, The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?,male
WILLIAM," Well, thank you. Anytime -- time for bed.  Or... sofa- bed.",male
WILLIAM, Oh my God... Hello.,male
WILLIAM, Spike.,male
WILLIAM, Maybe.,male
WILLIAM, Yes.,male
WILLIAM, Yes.,male
WILLIAM, Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.,male
WILLIAM, Spike!,male
WILLIAM, I'll talk you in the morning.,male
WILLIAM, Oh please sod off.,male
WILLIAM, No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.,male
WILLIAM, Wow.,male
WILLIAM, Nothing.,male
WILLIAM," It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.",male
WILLIAM, Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.,male
WILLIAM, Well...,male
WILLIAM," More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...",male
WILLIAM," Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...",male
WILLIAM," No, beats me.",male
WILLIAM, Who was Gilda?,male
WILLIAM, You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.,male
WILLIAM, Stay forever.,male
WILLIAM, Jesus Christ.,male
WILLIAM, Don't ask.,male
WILLIAM," Undressed like this, yes.",male
WILLIAM, I wouldn't go outside.,male
WILLIAM, Just take my work for it.,male
WILLIAM, How are you doing?,male
WILLIAM, I don't know what happened.,male
WILLIAM, That's not true.,male
WILLIAM," Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry.",male
WILLIAM, You do?,male
WILLIAM," I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...",male
WILLIAM, That's spectacularly unfair.,male
WILLIAM, Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.,male
WILLIAM," Spike, check who that is... and for God's sake put some clothes on.",male
WILLIAM," That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior. Can't we just laugh about this? Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.",male
WILLIAM," Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped -- she slipped down-stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.",male
WILLIAM, I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.,male
WILLIAM," Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.",male
WILLIAM," Right.  Fine!  I will do the opposite, if it's all right by you -- and always be glad you came. But you're right -- you probably better go.",male
WILLIAM, Was it you?,male
WILLIAM, Right.,male
WILLIAM, Blimey.  What's that?,male
WILLIAM," Well, thanks, that's great.",male
WILLIAM, Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.,male
WILLIAM," Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.",male
WILLIAM, But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.,male
WILLIAM, I believe I have.,male
WILLIAM," No, don't think I do.",male
WILLIAM, Oh God no.,male
WILLIAM, Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...,male
WILLIAM," No, no.  She doesn't.",male
WILLIAM," Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...",male
WILLIAM, I only found out you were here yesterday.,male
WILLIAM, Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.,male
WILLIAM, Okay.,male
WILLIAM, This is Henry James film?,male
WILLIAM, That's great.,male
WILLIAM, Of course.,male
WILLIAM, Thank you.,male
WILLIAM, I'm going to throw out these old videos.,male
WILLIAM, Right -- let's talk about rent...,male
WILLIAM," Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?",male
WILLIAM," Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?",male
WILLIAM, Hello.,male
WILLIAM, Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.,male
WILLIAM," Fine.  Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory...",male
WILLIAM, Thank you.  Shall I...,male
WILLIAM," Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.",male
WILLIAM, What's the thing?,male
WILLIAM, Don't even think about it.  Go away immediately.,male
WILLIAM, You were saying...,male
WILLIAM, But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.,male
WILLIAM, Can you tell me I'll ring her back.,male
WILLIAM," Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?",male
WILLIAM, Sorry about that.,male
WILLIAM, Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level- headed bloke.  Not often in and out of love.  But...,male
WILLIAM, ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?,male
WILLIAM, The truth is...,male
WILLIAM," ... with you, I'm in real danger. It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.",male
WILLIAM, I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.,male
WILLIAM, What do you think?  Good move?,male
WILLIAM, Tony -- what do you think?,male
WILLIAM, Brilliant.  Max?,male
WILLIAM, Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.,male
WILLIAM," Yes, I think that one may be.",male
WILLIAM, Yes -- sort of...,male
WILLIAM, What?,male
WILLIAM," It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be --but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.",male
WILLIAM," Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong decision, haven't I?",male
WILLIAM," Max, how fast is your car?",male
WILLIAM, No!,male
WILLIAM, Is Miss Scott staying here?,male
WILLIAM, How about Miss Flintstone?,male
WILLIAM," Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?",male
WILLIAM, Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.,male
WILLIAM," Excuse me, where's the press conference?",male
WILLIAM, Yes...,male
WILLIAM, That's right... I work for their in- house magazine. 'Movies are our business.',male
WILLIAM, Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends?,male
WILLIAM, And what would you say...,male
WILLIAM," Yes, I just wondered whether if it turned out that this... person...",male
WILLIAM," Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker realized he'd been a draft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider, whether you would... reconsider.",male
WILLIAM, That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.,male
SPIKE," Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?",male
SPIKE, That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.,male
SPIKE, Well... wait for it... First there's this one...,male
SPIKE, Point taken.,male
SPIKE, I suspect you'll prefer the next one.,male
SPIKE, Wouldn't want that... -- just one more.,male
SPIKE, Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.,male
SPIKE, Hi.,male
SPIKE, I'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food -- and then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.,male
SPIKE, There's something wrong with this yogurt.,male
SPIKE," Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.",male
SPIKE, Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.,male
SPIKE, Hey.,male
SPIKE, Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...,male
SPIKE," Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.",male
SPIKE, There's something wrong with the goggles though...,male
SPIKE, Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.,male
SPIKE," Yeh, I wrote a couple down.",male
SPIKE, You want me to write down all your messages?,male
SPIKE," Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was --one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.",male
SPIKE, Absolutely not.,male
SPIKE, Though if we're going for this obsessive writing-down-all-messages thing -- some American girl called Anna called a few days ago.,male
SPIKE," Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.",male
SPIKE, Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...,male
SPIKE, Try 'Flinstone.',male
SPIKE, I think she said her name was 'Flinstone.',male
SPIKE," No, 'fraid not.",male
SPIKE," That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?",male
SPIKE, You're welcome.  Did you find them?,male
SPIKE, Come on -- open up -- this is me -- Spikey -- I'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrators. What's wrong?,male
SPIKE," Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.",male
SPIKE, Yeh.  Yeh...tricky...tricky...I knew a girl at school called Pandora ... never got to see her box though.,male
SPIKE, Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic,male
SPIKE, Just checking.,male
SPIKE," Thank you, God.",male
SPIKE," Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni.",male
SPIKE," I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.",male
SPIKE, Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.,male
SPIKE," I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy-friend, that's right isn't it?",male
SPIKE, And she's in your house.,male
SPIKE, And you get on very well.,male
SPIKE," Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?",male
SPIKE, Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?,male
SPIKE, No -- you're right.,male
SPIKE," Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.",male
SPIKE," Morning, daring ones.",male
SPIKE, Why not?,male
SPIKE, How did I look?,male
SPIKE," Not bad.  No bad at all.  Well- chosen briefs, I'd say.  Chick love grey. Mmmmm.  Nice firm buttocks.",male
SPIKE, I went out in my goddamn underwear too.,male
SPIKE, Looks like a chauffeur to me.,male
SPIKE, What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.,male
SPIKE, I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.,male
SPIKE, Me?,male
SPIKE," Well, yes.  Groovy.",male
SPIKE, What's going on?,male
SPIKE, No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.,male
SPIKE, Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.,male
SPIKE, I was called and I came.  What's up?,male
SPIKE, You draft prick!,male
SPIKE, Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.,male
SPIKE, Go!,male
SPIKE, What happened?,male
MARTIN, Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.,male
MARTIN, Cappuccino as ordered.,male
MARTIN, Who?  Someone famous?,male
MARTIN," Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.",male
MARTIN, That's right -- Topol.,male
MARTIN," No, well... he was quite a long way away.",male
MARTIN, I suppose so.,male
MARTIN," Not classic, no.",male
MARTIN," Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.",male
MARTIN, Can I help you?,male
MARTIN," I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.",male
MARTIN, But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.,male
MARTIN, Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.,male
MARTIN," I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...",male
MARTIN," Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.",male
MARTIN, Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.,male
MARTIN, Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?,male
MARTIN, Oh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been a bit of an ass.,male
MARTIN," Anyway... it's lovely to meet you. I'm a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of course.",male
ANNA," No, thanks.  I'll just look around.",female
ANNA, Really?,female
ANNA, Thanks.  I'll think about it.,female
ANNA," No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.",female
ANNA, Yes.,female
ANNA, What's your name?,female
ANNA," Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'",female
ANNA," Tempting but... no, thank you.",female
ANNA, I think I will try this one.,female
ANNA, Thanks.,female
ANNA, Oh Jesus.,female
ANNA, What are you doing?,female
ANNA, No thank you.  I need to get my car back.,female
ANNA, Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.,female
ANNA, No thanks.,female
ANNA, No.,female
ANNA," Really, no.",female
ANNA, No.,female
ANNA, No. I better be going.  Thanks for your help.,female
ANNA, Thank you.,female
ANNA, I forgot my bag.,female
ANNA, Thanks.  Well...,female
ANNA, Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.,female
ANNA, Hi.,female
ANNA, Probably best not tell anyone about this.,female
ANNA, Bye.,female
ANNA, No.,female
ANNA, I've got nothing to smile about.,female
ANNA, Hello.,female
ANNA," Oh no, ho -- these are great.",female
ANNA," No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.",female
ANNA," Yes, thanks.",female
ANNA, Is that so?,female
ANNA," Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.",female
ANNA," No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.",female
ANNA, It takes place on a submarine.,female
ANNA, And what happens next in the dream?,female
ANNA, Yes.,female
ANNA," Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.",female
ANNA, Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.,female
ANNA, Okay -- fine.,female
ANNA," No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.",female
ANNA, If that's all right.,female
ANNA, Okay.,female
ANNA, Hi.,female
ANNA, Thank you.,female
ANNA, Hiya.,female
ANNA, Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday.,female
ANNA, I'll think about it.,female
ANNA, I'm an actress.,female
ANNA," Well, they can be.",female
ANNA, Films mainly.,female
ANNA, Fifteen million dollars.,female
ANNA, I wonder if you could tell me where the...?,female
ANNA, I'm a vegetarian.,female
ANNA, Wait a minute.  What about me?,female
ANNA, Well... a shot at it.,female
ANNA," Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.",female
ANNA," Really -- and one day, not long from now...",female
ANNA," ... my looks will go, they'll find out I can't act and I'll become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.",female
ANNA, That was such a great evening.,female
ANNA, And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.,female
ANNA, You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.,female
ANNA, Lovely to meet you.,female
ANNA," Night, night, Honey.",female
ANNA, You too -- from now on you are my style guru.,female
ANNA," Floppy, huh?",female
ANNA, Why is she in a wheelchair?,female
ANNA, And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?,female
ANNA, Too complicated.,female
ANNA, Busy tomorrow?,female
ANNA, I was.,female
ANNA, What's in there?,female
ANNA, Let's go in.,female
ANNA, You abide by rules like that?,female
ANNA, What did you say?,female
ANNA," Yes, you did.",female
ANNA," You said ""whoopsidaisies.""",female
ANNA," There's no ""unless.""  No one has said ""whoopsidaisies"" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.",female
ANNA, Step aside.,female
ANNA," Come on, Flops.",female
ANNA," ""For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her.""",female
ANNA, Some people do spend their whole lives together.,female
ANNA, So who left who?,female
ANNA, Why?,female
ANNA, Uh-oh.  That's not good.,female
ANNA," No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.",female
ANNA, In fact -- give me a second.,female
ANNA, Hi.,female
ANNA, I'm sorry about my friend -- he's very sensitive.,female
ANNA," Please, please -- let's just leave it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm, and I'm sure it was just friendly banter and I'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts. A perfect match for the size of your brains. Enjoy your meal.  The tuna's really good.",female
ANNA, I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.,female
ANNA, I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?,female
ANNA, I don't know either.,female
ANNA, Here we are. Do you want to come up?,female
ANNA, There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?,female
ANNA, Give me five minutes.,female
ANNA, Hiya.,female
ANNA, You've got to go.,female
ANNA," Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.",female
ANNA, Yes...,female
ANNA, Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.,female
ANNA, Nice surprise.,female
ANNA, I haven't decided.,female
ANNA, I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.,female
ANNA, Hi.  Can I come in?,female
ANNA, They were taken years ago -- I know it was...,female
ANNA, I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.,female
ANNA," Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.",female
ANNA, These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...,female
ANNA, A bath would be great.,female
ANNA, You must be Spike.,female
ANNA, Hi.,female
ANNA," I'm really sorry about last time. He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.",female
ANNA, I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?,female
ANNA, I have thought about you.,female
ANNA, Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.,female
ANNA, Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.,female
ANNA," Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.",female
ANNA, I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.,female
ANNA," 'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.",female
ANNA, 'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?,female
ANNA, Damn.  'And Wainwright...',female
ANNA," 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'",female
ANNA, My son's name is Johnny?,female
ANNA," Well, get a message through to him too.",female
ANNA, What do you think?,female
ANNA, You think I should do Henry James instead?,female
ANNA, Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star over.',female
ANNA, I can't believe you have that picture on your wall.,female
ANNA, I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.,female
ANNA, Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.,female
ANNA, Fantastic.,female
ANNA, You've got big feet.,female
ANNA, You know what they say about men with big feet?,female
ANNA, Big feet -- large shoes.,female
ANNA, The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.,female
ANNA," Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek, in the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'",female
ANNA," I could have a stunt bottom, yes.",female
ANNA, Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.,female
ANNA," Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?",female
ANNA, Both.,female
ANNA, Today has been a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.,female
ANNA, Right.,female
ANNA, Okay.,female
ANNA, What?,female
ANNA, You and every person in this country.,female
ANNA, What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?,female
ANNA," No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...",female
ANNA, But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?,female
ANNA, Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?,female
ANNA, Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality --do you feel that way with me?,female
ANNA, Oh.,female
ANNA, I'll be back.,female
ANNA," Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch.",female
ANNA, Can I stay a bit longer?,female
ANNA," Damn, I forgot the jam.",female
ANNA," You get the door, I'll get the jam.",female
ANNA, What?,female
ANNA, You're up to something...,female
ANNA, Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?,female
ANNA, Jesus.,female
ANNA," It's Anna.  The press are here.  No, there are hundreds of them.  My brilliant plan was not so brilliant at all.  Yeh, I know, I know.  Just get me out then. Damnit.",female
ANNA, How do you think I'm doing?,female
ANNA, I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.,female
ANNA, Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then go out in your goddamn underwear.,female
ANNA," This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.",female
ANNA, As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.,female
ANNA," You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone, you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you --you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'",female
ANNA," Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.",female
ANNA, I don't want a goddamn cup of tea. I want to go home.,female
ANNA, And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.,female
ANNA," You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspective are different.",female
ANNA, Excuse me?,female
ANNA, You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.,female
ANNA, This is certainly... ah...,female
ANNA, I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...,female
ANNA, It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.,female
ANNA, But... wait... there are things to say.,female
ANNA, Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.,female
ANNA, We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.,female
ANNA, I'm not listening.,female
ANNA," I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well- advised to keep quiet.",female
ANNA," So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?",female
ANNA, And then I... right.,female
ANNA, Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  But of an awkward situation.,female
ANNA, Hi.,female
ANNA, You disappeared.,female
ANNA, Well... how have you been?,female
ANNA," Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...",female
ANNA, I thought I'd give it to you.,female
ANNA," No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.",female
ANNA," I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is...",female
ANNA," Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.",female
ANNA, You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?,female
ANNA, Is that right?,female
ANNA, I can't say I know Patrick all that well.,female
ANNA," Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'",female
ANNA, That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.,female
ANNA," ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.",female
ANNA," I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?",female
ANNA, Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.,female
ANNA," The fame thing isn't really real, you know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl.  Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her.",female
ANNA, Bye.,female
ANNA, No time at all.  I fly out tonight.,female
ANNA, Absolutely not.,female
ANNA," It's really not my business any more. Though I will say, from my experience, that rumours about Jeff... do tend to be true.",female
ANNA, He was just a friend -- I think we're still friends.,female
ANNA," I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.",female
ANNA," No, let him... ask away.  You were saying?",female
ANNA," Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.",female
ANNA, Indefinitely.,female
THIEF, Yes.,male
THIEF, What?,male
THIEF, So?,male
THIEF, What book?,male
THIEF, I haven't got a book down my trousers.,male
THIEF, Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?,male
THIEF, Excuse me.,male
THIEF, Can I have your autograph?,male
THIEF, Rufus.,male
THIEF, What does it say?,male
THIEF, Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?,male
ANNA, Hi.,female
ANNA," You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.",female
ANNA, Oh -- Okay.,female
ANNA," Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.",female
ANNA, Come in.,female
KAREN," Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things are running a bit late.  Here's the thing...",female
KAREN, What did you think of the film?,female
KAREN, I'm sorry I didn't get down what magazines you're from.,female
KAREN, Great.  And you...,female
KAREN, Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.,female
KAREN, Mr. Thacker.,female
KAREN, You've got five minutes.,female
KAREN, If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.,female
KAREN, Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.',female
KAREN, Mr. Thacker?,female
KAREN, Have you got a moment?,female
KAREN, Come and have a look...,female
KAREN, Are you a fan of Henry James?,female
KAREN, This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue.,female
JEREMY, Everything okay?,male
JEREMY, And you are from 'Horse and Hound' magazine?,male
JEREMY," Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer.",male
JEREMY," Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was so short.  Did you get what you wanted?",male
JEREMY, Maybe time for one last question?,male
JEREMY, Yes... You -- Dominic.,male
JEREMY, Which is why we have to round it up now. Final questions.,male
JEREMY," Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.",male
JEREMY," No, it's just one question per person.",male
JEREMY, Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your question again?,male
MAX, He's bringing a girl?,male
MAX, Does the girl have a name?,male
MAX," Christ, what is going on in there?",male
MAX, Oh God.,male
MAX, Come on in.  Vague food crisis.,male
MAX, Okay.  Crisis over.,male
MAX," Hello, Anna ahm... Scott -- have some wine.",male
MAX, Hi.,male
MAX," Yes, Happy Birthday.",male
MAX," Look, your brother has brought this girl, and ahm...",male
MAX, That'll be Bernie.,male
MAX," Hello, Bernie.",male
MAX, Bernie -- this is Anna.,male
MAX," You haven't slept with her, have you?",male
MAX, 'No comment' means 'yes.',male
MAX, Do you ever masturbate?,male
MAX, You see -- it means 'yes.',male
MAX, Right -- I think we're ready.,male
MAX," Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under- achievers.",male
MAX," I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.",male
MAX," You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken, your job still pays you rather a lot of money, while Honey here, she earns nothing flogging her guts out at London's seediest record store.",male
MAX, You see -- incredibly sad.,male
MAX," Well, I don't know.  Look at William.  Very unsuccessful professionally.  Divorced.  Used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy around the edges -- and absolutely certain never to hear from Anna again after she's heard that his nickname at school was Floppy.",male
MAX," I think you do, yes.",male
MAX, I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?,male
MAX," Nah!!!  Nice try, gorgeous -- but you don't fool anyone.",male
MAX, I'm delighted.,male
MAX, Now you're lying.,male
MAX, No!,male
MAX, You didn't know she had a boyfriend?,male
MAX, Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to morals who get involved with the gods.,male
MAX, Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.,male
MAX," Her name is Tessa and she works in the contracts department.  The hair, I admit, is unfashionable frizzy -- but she's as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.  Apparently.",male
MAX, Now -- try.,male
MAX, Tessa -- this is Bella my wife.,male
MAX, And this is William.,male
MAX, Keziah -- some woodcock?,male
MAX, I don't realize that.,male
MAX, Thank you.  I'm sorry about the lamb.,male
MAX, Well?,male
MAX, That's not fair.,male
MAX, Is it someone we know?,male
MAX, Any more announcements?,male
MAX, There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.,male
MAX, So -- you've laid the ghost.,male
MAX, Don't give a damn about the famous girl.,male
MAX," Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.",male
MAX," So not over her, in fact.",male
MAX, Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.,male
MAX, If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.,male
MAX, Where's Bella?,male
MAX, Sod that.  Bernie -- in the back!,male
MAX," Come on, babe.",male
MAX," Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Center.",male
MAX, Stop right there!  I will decide the route.  All right?,male
MAX, James Bond never has to put up with this sort of shit.,male
MAX, Go!,male
BELLA, Miracles do happen.,female
BELLA, He wouldn't say.,female
BELLA, Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.,female
BELLA, Don't even ask.,female
BELLA, Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...,female
BELLA, Right.,female
BELLA," Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.",female
BELLA," Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?",female
BELLA, Yes.,female
BELLA, Yup.,female
BELLA, What do you think of the guinea fowl?,female
BELLA, Oh God.,female
BELLA," On the other hand, her best friend is Anna Scott.",female
BELLA," And most of her limbs work.  Whereas I'm stuck in its thing day and night, in a house full of ramps. And to add insult to serious injury -- I've totally given up smoking, my favorite thing, and the truth is... we can't have a baby.",female
BELLA," C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.",female
BELLA, And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.,female
BELLA, That's right.,female
BELLA, And?,female
BELLA, Still loves you though.,female
BELLA, I never fancied you much actually...,female
BELLA, I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...,female
BELLA, Do you want to stay?,female
BELLA," I have a little speech to make -- I won't stand up because I can't... be bothered. Exactly a year ago today, this man here started the finest restaurant in London.",female
BELLA, Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat here.,female
BELLA," And so much face the fact that from next week, we have to find somewhere near to eat.",female
BELLA," I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...",female
BELLA, No!,female
BELLA, I'm really horribly drunk.,female
BELLA, Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.,female
BELLA," This painting isn't the original, is it?",female
BELLA, Where are you going?,female
BELLA, Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...,female
BELLA, He's with me.,female
BELLA, Writing an article about how London hotels treat people in wheelchairs.,female
HONEY, Hi guys. Oh holy fuck.,female
HONEY," Oh God this is one of those key moments in life, when it's possible you can be really, genuinely cool -- and totally and utterly adore you and I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world and more importantly I genuinely believe and have believed for some time now that we can be best friends. What do you think?",female
HONEY, Oh my God.  You gave me a present. We're best friends already.  Marry Will -- he's a really nice guy and then we can be sisters.,female
HONEY, I'll show you.,female
HONEY, I don't believe it.  I walked into the loo with her.  I was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans... She had to ask me to leave.,female
HONEY, Nonsense.  I fancy you.  Or I did before you got so far.,female
HONEY," Yes.  And I don't have hair -- I've got feathers, and I've got funny goggly eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and ... no one'll ever marry me because my boosies have actually started shrinking.",female
HONEY," That's true, I can't deny it.  She needs me, what can I say?",female
HONEY, Really?,female
HONEY," I'm so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to leave but I just... look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with.  I know lots of nice, cheap places... not that money necessarily... Nice to meet you.",female
HONEY, Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.,female
HONEY, The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!,female
HONEY," It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.",female
HONEY," Since it's an evening of announcements ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've got engaged.",female
HONEY," I've found myself a nice, slightly odd looking bloke who I know is going to make me happy for the rest of my life.",female
HONEY, Yes.  I will keep you informed.,female
HONEY, By the way -- it's you.,female
HONEY, Yes.  What do you think?,female
HONEY," Good move: when all is sad and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.",female
HONEY, William has just turned down Anna Scott.,female
HONEY, She's not coming.,female
HONEY, That's right -- then Park Lane.,female
HONEY, You're my hero.,female
HONEY, Run!,female
HONEY, It was good.,female
BERNIE," I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.",male
BERNIE," Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.",male
BERNIE, Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you. It's a hat.  You don't have to wear it or anything.,male
BERNIE, So tell me Anna -- what do you do?,male
BERNIE," Splendid.  I'm actually in the stockmarket, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?",male
BERNIE," I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?",male
BERNIE," Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?",male
BERNIE, Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?,male
BERNIE, Anna Scott?,male
BERNIE, The movie star?,male
BERNIE, Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.,male
BERNIE, Shame!,male
BERNIE," Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.",male
BERNIE, No.  Not true...,male
BERNIE, Love your work.,male
BERNIE, ... get fired.,male
BERNIE," Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side --and of course... I was total crap.",male
BERNIE, But she said she wanted to go out with you?,male
BERNIE, That's nice.,male
BERNIE," Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...",male
BERNIE, And we intend to use them!,male
BERNIE," Or you could go right down to Cromwell Road, and left.",male
BERNIE," Bloody hell, this is fun.",male
