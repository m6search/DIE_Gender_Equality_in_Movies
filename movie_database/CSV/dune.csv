CHANI, Paul...,female
CHANI, But not me.,female
CHANI, I knew.,female
CHANI, Paul. You need to wake up.,female
CHANI, Lisan al Gaib.,female
CHANI, I would not have let you hurt my friends.,female
CHANI, I don’t believe you are the Lisan Al Gaib. But I want you to die with honor.,female
CHANI, Jamis is a strong fighter. He won’t let you suffer.,female
CHANI, Yes?,female
CHANI, This is only the beginning.,female
PAUL, Mother.,male
JESSICA, It’s good you’re up early. Your father wants you in full dress before the Emperor’s Herald arrives.,female
JESSICA, Ceremonial.,female
JESSICA, Ceremony.,female
JESSICA," If you want it, make me give it to you. Use the Voice.",female
JESSICA, The glass can’t hear you. Command me.,female
JESSICA, Almost.,female
JESSICA, Better than any man has ever done.,female
JESSICA, Get dressed and come with me.,female
JESSICA, The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here. She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now she is Truthsayer to the Emperor himself. She would like to meet you. She wants to know about your dreams.,female
JESSICA, I’ll give you a moment.,female
JESSICA," Paul, please. Remember your training.",female
JESSICA, You must do everything the Reverend Mother tells you.,female
JESSICA, I must not fear. Fear is the mind- killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.,female
JESSICA, I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.,female
JESSICA, Where the fear has gone there will be nothing!,female
JESSICA, Only I will remain.,female
JESSICA, Was this necessary?,female
JESSICA, Was I wrong?,female
JESSICA, Do you see so little hope?,female
JESSICA, Paul. I’m so sorry.,female
JESSICA, I know. It’s a terrible ordeal. But there are reasons...,female
JESSICA, You heard.,female
JESSICA," You don’t know everything. For thousands of years, we’ve been carefully crossing bloodlines to bring forth...",female
JESSICA, A mind powerful enough to bridge space and time. Past and future... who can help lead us into a better future. We think he’s very close now. Some believe he’s here.,female
JESSICA, Yes!,female
JESSICA, Lisan al-Gaib. Voice from the Outer World. It’s their name for messiah.,female
JESSICA, Preparing the way. These people have been waiting for centuries for the Lisan al-Gaib. They look at you and see the signs.,female
JESSICA, Oh. Is this Arrakeen custom?,female
JESSICA, Please rise.,female
JESSICA, The rest of you may go.,female
JESSICA, I know many things. I know you have a weapon concealed in your bodice.,female
JESSICA, Not now.,female
JESSICA, It’s a crysknife.,female
JESSICA, Be ready for violence.,female
JESSICA," Thank you, Dr Yueh.",female
JESSICA, What did you see?,female
JESSICA, You can’t know that. I barely know that. It’s only been a few weeks...,female
JESSICA, You have to sleep.,female
JESSICA, Close your eyes.,female
JESSICA, Don’t do this. You are not ready!,female
JESSICA, Your pitch was too high.,female
JESSICA, KILL HIM. NOW.,female
JESSICA, Harkonnen battle language. They’re demanding a counter-phrase.,female
JESSICA, They’ll be on their way.,female
JESSICA, Paul...,female
JESSICA, You’re afraid. What do you see that you fear?,female
JESSICA, Paul.,female
JESSICA, Your name is Paul. Paul Atreides. You are the Duke Paul Atreides.,female
JESSICA, Dr. Kynes.,female
JESSICA, You’re sure?,female
JESSICA, So. The Emperor’s taken a side. What says the Judge of the Change?,female
JESSICA, Chaos. Across the Imperium.,female
JESSICA, Careful...,female
JESSICA," Paul, no!",female
JESSICA, You’re not coming with us?,female
JESSICA, How?,female
JESSICA, Jet-flares behind us.,female
JESSICA, There’s greenery over there.,female
JESSICA, Run!,female
JESSICA," We have powerful friends. If you help us get offworld, to Caladan -- you’ll be well rewarded.",female
JESSICA, The conversation ran short.,female
JESSICA, Paul. Come down.,female
JESSICA, No. Paul has never killed a man.,female
JESSICA, Paul needs to get offworld. You must have ways. Smugglers. Ships...,female
PAUL, Full dress. Military?,male
PAUL," Why do we have to go through all this, when it’s already been decided?",male
PAUL, I just woke up. Can I please-- ?,male
PAUL, GIVE ME THE WATERRRRRR.,male
PAUL, GIVE ME THE WATER.,male
PAUL, Almost?,male
PAUL, No.,male
PAUL, Duncan.,male
PAUL, I did?,male
PAUL, So... you’re going back to Arrakis tomorrow. With the advance team.,male
PAUL, I would like you to take me with you.,male
PAUL, Duncan--,male
PAUL, Can I trust you with something?,male
PAUL, I’ve been having dreams. About Arrakis.,male
PAUL, And there’s...,male
PAUL, ...there’s a girl.,male
PAUL, I saw the Harkonnen legions...,male
PAUL, The first dream was a month ago. Before any of this happened.,male
PAUL, I dreamt about you. With the Fremen.,male
PAUL, I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle. Your face clean-shaven.,male
PAUL, Duncan...,male
PAUL, You don’t think we’ll ever come back?,male
PAUL," Father, I’m here to ask you to join Duncan Idaho’s scout mission on Arrakis. I’d be an asset to him.",male
PAUL," Great leaders are raised in the mud, not around tables.",male
PAUL, Grandfather fought bulls for sport!,male
PAUL, What if I’m not?,male
PAUL, The future of House Atreides.,male
PAUL, You never told me that.,male
PAUL, I will.,male
PAUL," I could tell it was you by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.",male
PAUL," Not today. Without Duncan, what’s the point?",male
PAUL, I guess I’m not in the mood today.,male
PAUL, I have you.,male
PAUL, Will it be that bad?,male
PAUL, Mother. What’s wrong?,male
PAUL, What is this?,male
PAUL, How does she know about my dreams?,male
PAUL, What is happening?,male
PAUL, What are you saying?,male
PAUL, You dismiss my mother in her own house.,male
PAUL, How dare you use the Voice on me?,male
PAUL, What’s in the box?,male
PAUL, Why are you doing this?,male
PAUL, Because I’m a Duke’s son?,male
PAUL, My father rules an entire planet.,male
PAUL, He’s getting a richer planet!,male
PAUL, I had one tonight.,male
PAUL, A girl. On Arrakis.,male
PAUL, Many times.,male
PAUL, Not exactly. Sometimes.,male
PAUL, I could have died.,male
PAUL, What does it mean? That I could be the One?,male
PAUL, You steer the politics of the Imperium from the shadows. I know.,male
PAUL, ...the One?,male
PAUL, All part of a plan. Do you... love my father?,male
PAUL, Thufir Hawat.,male
PAUL, I’m excited to say the least!,male
PAUL, They were pointing at us. What are they shouting?,male
PAUL, Planting superstitions.,male
PAUL, They see what they’ve been told to see.,male
PAUL, What about them?,male
PAUL, I didn’t know date palms could be found here.,male
PAUL, Should we remove them?,male
PAUL, Thanks for the humiliation old man.,male
PAUL, All of them?,male
PAUL, How can this stand? Isn’t there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition?,male
PAUL, Duncan!,male
PAUL," Well, you smell much worse.",male
PAUL, How big was the place?,male
PAUL, It’s true.,male
PAUL, Won’t you stay? We would honor you.,male
PAUL, The Fremen make these?,male
PAUL, You admire them.,male
PAUL, You’re the Imperial Ecologist. Thank you for the stillsuits.,male
PAUL, This is the first time.,male
PAUL, It seemed the right way.,male
PAUL, Are you Fremen?,male
PAUL, What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here?,male
PAUL, Why don’t we shield the crawlers?,male
PAUL, Is there any way to kill that thing?,male
PAUL, That’s still three short.,male
PAUL, A shield generator weighs a hundred kilos.,male
PAUL, Yes Sire!,male
PAUL, THIS WAY! Seven there! Seven in here!,male
PAUL, I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.,male
PAUL, This wasn’t an allergic reaction. I inhaled spice and I had visions. With my eyes wide open.,male
PAUL, I know you are pregnant.,male
PAUL, Legend is a pretty word for a lie.,male
PAUL, How can I make my way if my destiny was written before I was born?,male
PAUL, The scarred trooper is deaf.,male
PAUL, Don’t you dare touch my mother!,male
PAUL, REMOVE HER GAG.,male
PAUL, REMOVE HER GAG.,male
PAUL, It’s a fremkit. Fremen survival gear. It’ll give us a chance.,male
PAUL, They’ve crippled the ship.,male
PAUL," Sand compactor. Paracompass. Thumper. “Maker hooks,” whatever they are. The Manual of the Desert. No stillsuits. The one thing we...",male
PAUL, There’s something awakening in my mind.,male
PAUL, Holy war. Spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. A warrior religion that waves the Atreides banner. Fanatical legions worshipping at the shrine of my father’s skull. A crusade. In my name. My name. That’s the future. It’s coming.,male
PAUL, GET OFF ME!,male
PAUL, Someone is near. You need to drink.,male
PAUL, That’s Duncan!,male
PAUL, Fremen?,male
PAUL, Is there anyone else left?,male
PAUL, Yet you risk your life to help us.,male
PAUL, Who are you to the Fremen?,male
PAUL, Do you know what the Great Houses fear most? Just what’s happening here. The Sardaukar picking them off one by one. Only together can they stand against the Imperium. Would you bear witness? Testify that the Emperor moved against us here?,male
PAUL, But suppose I presented the Emperor with an alternative to chaos. The Emperor has no sons. Only daughters.,male
PAUL," You will call me my Lord or Sire. Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to Paradise.",male
PAUL," I know you loved a Fremen warrior, and lost him in battle. I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names. I know your dream.",male
PAUL, Duncan!,male
PAUL, Thank you. Good luck!,male
PAUL, I must not fear. Fear is the mind- killer.,male
PAUL," As soon as we’re down, run for the rocks.",male
PAUL, Now we have to find the Fremen.,male
PAUL, That has to mean people. We’ll cross after dark. Like the Fremen do.,male
PAUL, Remember. Walk without rhythm. Like the Fremen do. Erratic movement.,male
PAUL, Someone called it.,male
PAUL, Stilgar!,male
PAUL, I was there when you came to my father’s council. With Duncan Idaho. You know me.,male
PAUL, One move and you die.,male
PAUL, Chani...,male
PAUL, I... Never mind.,male
PAUL, Do you yield?,male
PAUL, No.,male
PAUL, Desert power!,male
PAUL, Give. Me. The Water.,male
PAUL, Better than anyone else has ever done.,male
PAUL, Are you the new Weapons Master?,male
PAUL, That is rude.,male
PAUL, Old man.,male
PAUL, Why is Doctor Yueh here?,male
PAUL, This is Doctor Yueh’s handwriting. “There is an Atreides transmitter in the Fremkit. If anyone survives. They’ll find you.”,male
PAUL, You did this to me! You BENE GESSERIT. You made me a freak!,male
PAUL, Let’s get out of here.,male
PAUL," As Emperor, I could make a Paradise of Arrakis with a wave of my hand.",male
PAUL, Drum sand!,male
PAUL," The Emperor sent us to this place. And my father came -- not for the spice, but for the strength of these people. I am the Duke now. And my road leads into the desert. I can see it. If you’ll have us.",male
PAUL, We will come. And learn your ways.,male
JESSICA, You look tired. More dreams?,female
JESSICA, Paul.,female
JESSICA, And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.,female
JESSICA," The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners to the Great Houses, but there’s more to it.",female
JESSICA," Oh, Paul.",female
JESSICA, It means the Bene Gesserit have been at work here.,female
JESSICA, What is your name?,female
JESSICA," If you mean to harm me, I warn you: whatever you’re hiding won’t be enough.",female
JESSICA, It’s a maker of...,female
JESSICA, SET US FREE.,female
JESSICA, STOP!,female
JESSICA, CUT ME LOOSE.,female
JESSICA, GIVE ME THE KNIFE.,female
JESSICA, He’s gone!,female
JESSICA, We’re not high enough!,female
JESSICA, Paul...!,female
LETO," Smile, Gurney.",male
LETO, How much will they spend traveling here for this formality?,male
LETO," For centuries, House Atreides has stood for honor. Not only for itself, but for the benefit of all. Now the Emperor gives us his unconditional trust. He wants us to BRING PEACE ON ARRAKIS!",male
LETO, I miss him.,male
LETO, I think Arrakis is far away.,male
LETO," Out of the question. You’ll travel to Arrakis in a few weeks, like the rest of us.",male
LETO, Don’t throw my words back at me. You have responsibilities Duncan Idaho will never have.,male
LETO, Yes. And look where that got him.,male
LETO, Not what?,male
LETO, I told my father I didn’t want this either.,male
LETO," My father said, A good man doesn’t seek to lead. He’s called to it, and he answers. If your answer is no, you’ll still be the only thing I’ve ever needed you to be -- my son.",male
LETO, To Duncan’s last night on Caladan!,male
LETO," The Emperor is no stranger to treachery. Nor the Harkonnens. We have to be ready for anything. But this is our time. The Atreides never back down from a challenge. And when we prevail, it will mean a better life for the people of Arrakis. For all of us. Until then-- we keep our spirits up for the men. Hmm?",male
LETO," How are you, old friend?",male
LETO, It’s so quiet.,male
LETO," Our two most vulnerable points are the spaceport and the refinery. I want you guarding them around the clock. If we can’t harvest spice and ship it off-world, we’re dead here.",male
LETO, What do they say about this hell hole again?,male
LETO, That’s what they say.,male
LETO, My dear cousin Leto. Welcome to Arrakis. There’s a lot to learn. I thought I’d give you a few pointers. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.,male
LETO, Let’s get started. Thufir. Operations.,male
LETO, How bad is it?,male
LETO, I want to see the harvesting fields for myself.,male
LETO, Have The Judge of the Change accompany us. We will make our case and at the same time have some Imperial protection.,male
LETO, This sietch. How was it hidden?,male
LETO, Millions of Fremen. You were right.,male
LETO, Well done.,male
LETO, Let him pass!,male
LETO, Diplomacy!,male
LETO," I know you’ve suffered under the Harkonnens. Name what you want. If it is in my power to grant, I will give it and ask for nothing.",male
LETO," Gurney. The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief, to rule and protect. I cannot promise not to travel in the desert, if duty compels me: but your sietches will be yours forever -- and you will never be hunted while I govern here.",male
LETO, But it will take time.,male
LETO, It’s all right.,male
LETO, I see it.,male
LETO, Wormsign?,male
LETO, Is that a worm?,male
LETO, How many men on that crawler?,male
LETO, Our ships can take six each.,male
LETO, We’ll find a way.,male
LETO," Yes! Gurney, have our escorts throw out their shield generators.",male
LETO, Paul stay behind and help the workers to get in!,male
LETO, Where are they? Delta Ajax niner! Put seven men each in my ships!,male
LETO, Damn the spice! I want every man off that crawler. Now!,male
LETO, You cannot take such risks. You have responsibilities.,male
LETO, Go!,male
LETO, You know what’ll happen if I fail to get spice production back on track. The Harkonnens will return.,male
LETO, I think you’re afraid it might be true.,male
LETO," If I tell you one day you’ll find yourself on a mountaintop -- what does that change? You still have to climb the mountain. Destiny grants us nothing -- and takes nothing away. We have to fight and bleed for the future we want. Because when all’s said and done, there’s only one way to find out if a prophecy is true. We earn it.",male
LETO, Not like that.,male
LETO, Security. Security. Hawat.,male
LETO, Why...?,male
LETO," Here I am, here I remain.",male
GURNEY, I am smiling.,male
GURNEY, You think we’ve won something?,male
GURNEY, So it is. The other Great Houses trust and admire us. And the Emperor is a jealous man. So. Maybe he’s giving Arrakis to us. Or maybe he’s giving us to Arrakis.,male
GURNEY, He knows. He -- He’s right here.,male
GURNEY, Don’t stand with your back to the door. How many times do we need to tell you?,male
GURNEY," With Duncan Idaho gone, I must make do as best I may.",male
GURNEY, Never let a man inside your guard! Even in sport! Not even me!,male
GURNEY," Mood?! What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood! Now fight!",male
GURNEY," Aye. But look down, m’lord.",male
GURNEY," Bad is a child’s word. You don’t get it, do you? You don’t really understand the grave nature of what’s happening to us.",male
GURNEY," “My lungs taste the air of Time, Blown past falling sand...”",male
GURNEY, Atreides!,male
GURNEY, Yeah. That’s what worries me too.,male
GURNEY," “To shower, you scrub your ass with sand,” my Lord. That’s what they say.",male
GURNEY, Spice workers.,male
GURNEY, Paul Atreides! Late to his first strategy meeting! Sorry to drag you out of bed.,male
GURNEY, “For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and the treasure hid in the sand.”,male
GURNEY, Who did the Emperor appoint?,male
GURNEY, A hostage. I love it.,male
GURNEY, You will address the Duke as “Sire” or “My Lord...”,male
GURNEY, I don’t like him.,male
GURNEY, What the hell’s a sand compactor?,male
GURNEY," My God, man, you’ve gone native.",male
GURNEY," The Judge of the Change, Sire. Dr. Liet Kynes.",male
GURNEY, Dust cloud!,male
GURNEY, A worm always comes?,male
GURNEY, They seem pretty calm about it.,male
GURNEY, What happens now?,male
GURNEY, Yes Sire!,male
GURNEY, Paul!,male
GURNEY," We have to run, Paul! Now!",male
GURNEY," I remember salt smoke from a beach fire, The seagulls crying on the strand...",male
GURNEY, God in Heaven. Get everything with guns off the ground!,male
GURNEY, WITH ME! WITH ME!,male
HAWAT," Three Guild Navigators, fifty-two parsecs...figure a hundred and forty decagrams of spice...a total of one-point-four-six million solaris, round-trip.",male
HAWAT, Young master! How does it feel to walk on another world?,male
HAWAT," My Lord, my advance team has secured the city. We’re still smoothing out a few rough spots.",male
HAWAT, Don’t be fooled by the welcome. They follow their old masters’ rules. Mandatory attendance. That’s Harkonnen love out there.,male
HAWAT, Let’s get you out of the sun. The heat can kill in this place.,male
HAWAT," Candidates for housekeeper, my Lady.",male
HAWAT, I secured a copy of the Harkonnens’ account books.,male
HAWAT, We won’t see profits like that for a while. Not with the equipment they left us.,male
HAWAT, These are spice silos. We must fill every crate.,male
HAWAT, Every twenty-five standard days.,male
HAWAT," Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist. Been here twenty years. Eccentric, from what I’m told.",male
HAWAT, I wouldn’t recommend that my Lord.,male
HAWAT," He’s here, my Lord!",male
HAWAT, The Harkonnen estimate was fifty thousand on the whole planet!,male
HAWAT, Our plan bears fruit...,male
HAWAT," Yes, it will take time.",male
LETO, We are House Atreides. There is no call we do not answer. There is no faith that we betray. The Emperor asks us to lead. House Atreides... ACCEPTS.,male
LETO, That damned bull.,male
LETO, I wish we could bring them all with us.,male
LETO," You know why. You’re the future of House Atreides, Paul.",male
LETO," I understand your impatience. When we get to Arrakis, I want you to have a seat on my council. It’s time to teach you how we lead.",male
LETO, I wanted to be a pilot.,male
LETO, I found my own way to it. You might find yours.,male
LETO," In their memory, give it a try.",male
LETO," Duncan, you’re a fine fighting man. But you look like a barbarian. Tonight, that beard comes off.",male
LETO, Stilgar. Welcome. I respect the personal dignity of any man who respects mine.,male
LETO, I’m glad you’ve come. I think your people and mine have much to offer one another.,male
LETO, This is Duke Leto Atreides. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner’s crew. We’ll put down on the west.,male
LETO," Everything they left is in shambles. It’s plain to see. We’ve been set up to fail. When you report to the Emperor, you must say the rules weren’t followed.",male
LETO," That’s what they call you, isn’t it? Voice From the Outer World.",male
LETO, It troubles you.,male
DUNCAN, Stabilizers still too lose.,male
DUNCAN, Dial faster.,male
DUNCAN, You put on muscle!,male
DUNCAN, No. Try eating something.,male
DUNCAN, Yeah.,male
DUNCAN, You do? Oh. Too bad. Because no.,male
DUNCAN, You trying to get me court- martialed? What’s going on?,male
DUNCAN, Always. You know that.,male
DUNCAN, Now we’re talking...,male
DUNCAN," Okay, so... you dreamed about stuff we all know about.",male
DUNCAN, Well... that’s a hell of coincidence.,male
DUNCAN, So I will find them! There’s a good omen! Right?,male
DUNCAN, Whew! Okay! Not gonna die! I shave for no man!,male
DUNCAN, That’s why you want to come with me! Listen. Dreams make good stories. But everything important happens while we’re awake. Because that’s when we make things happen.,male
DUNCAN, Gurney Halleck. You look grouchy. To Arrakis!,male
DUNCAN, Hey. We did. Our star is rising!,male
DUNCAN, Did you tell the Duke?,male
DUNCAN, PAUL!,male
DUNCAN, I hope the girl part’s true!,male
PAUL," I saw the spice sands in the deep desert. The Fremen, fighting for their lands.",male
PAUL, I watched them leave Arrakis.,male
PAUL," I recognize your footsteps, old man.",male
PAUL, My father is dead. Why can’t I cry?,male
PAUL, 8000 meters. We’re still climbing.,male
PAUL, I’ll need to time the top of the vortex. I can see it. It will be there... In few seconds... I can see it,male
CHANI, Paul...,female
CHANI, Paul...,female
CHANI, Some of my people thought a savior might never come.,female
CHANI, Bless your coming and going.,female
CHANI, May your passage cleanse the world.,female
CHANI, Will you keep it for your people?,female
GURNEY, Choose your blade.,male
GURNEY, Come on!,male
GURNEY, You’d have joined me in death.,male
GURNEY, I see you found the mood.,male
GURNEY," For eighty years Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen! Eighty years! Owning the spice fields! Can you imagine the wealth? Now they are losing Arrakis... to us. You need to be ready. -- Your eyes. I need to see it in your eyes! You never met Harkonnens before. I have. They're not human. In the slave pits of Geidi Prime, Rabban Harkonnen himself killed my family and he gave me this scar to remember him by.",male
GURNEY, And I will never forget.,male
GURNEY, I say it’s good for the spirit.,male
GURNEY, Go go go!,male
BARON HARKONNEN, Rabban.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, Very good.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, When a gift is not a gift?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, What is the Emperor’s message?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, With his Sardaukar army.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, House Harkonnen would never dream of violating the sanctity of your Order. You have my word. We will not harm them.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, No Atreides will live.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, I said I would not harm them. So I shall not. But Arrakis is Arrakis. The desert takes the weak.,male
BARON HARKONNEN," You have a good kitchen, cousin.",male
BARON HARKONNEN, The Traitor! What do you want?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, The bargain to the letter! And what was I to do for you?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, Ah. Yes.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, What did you say?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, So?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, So it’s done. At last.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, The Fremen? Kill them all.,male
BARON HARKONNEN," To break a virtuous man, give him a burden too heavy to bear. A lesser man would drop it: but a good man will carry it ‘til it crushes him.",male
BARON HARKONNEN, My desert. My Arrakis. My Dune.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, I said that I would set her free. That you could join her.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, So join her.,male
BARON HARKONNEN, What’s next?,male
BARON HARKONNEN, For centuries we traded blood for blood. But no more. Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead. Tonight House Atreides falls. Your bloodline ends forever.,male
BARON HARKONNEN," Send word to Giedi Prime to begin selling our spice reserves. Slowly! We don’t want the price to fall. You cannot imagine what it cost me to bring such force to bear here. I want you squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard.",male
JESSICA, Paul. Wake up.,female
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Defiance in the eyes. Like his father. Leave us.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, COME HERE.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Put your right hand in the box.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Pain.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape. What will you do?,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Silence!,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Enough!,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, No woman-child ever withstood so much. I must’ve wanted you to fail.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," Because you are Jessica’s son. You have more than one birthright, boy. You’ve proven you can rule yourself. Now you must learn to rule others. It’s something none of your ancestors learned.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, He’s losing it.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, We’ll see.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Tell me about these dreams.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, What did you see?,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Have you dreamt of her before?,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Do you dream things that happen just as you dreamed them?,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," Goodbye, young human. I hope you live.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," You chose to train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule. He wields our power: he had to be tested. So much potential, wasted in a male. You were told to bear only daughters! But you in your pride thought you could bring forth the Kwisatz Haderach.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," You’re lucky he didn’t die in that room. If he is the One, he has a long way to go. His Sight is barely awakened. And now he goes into the fire. But our plans are measured in centuries: we have other prospects, if he fails his promise.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you. A path has been laid. Let’s hope he doesn’t squander it.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Activate the cone of silence.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, He will strengthen your hand.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," It must never be known. As far as the Great Houses are concerned -- what you do, you do alone.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, KNEEL.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Your mother bade you obey me.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, STOP.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. A poison needle. Instant death. This test is simple. Remove your hand from the box, and you die.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, No need to call the guards. Your mother stands outside that door.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," Take your hand from the box, boy, and look at it.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Pain by nerve induction.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," Like sifting sand through a screen. We sift people. If you were unable to control your impulses, like an animal -- we could not let you live. You inherit too much power.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," Your mother was tested thus, when she was your age.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM," Duke Leto Atreides means nothing to our Order, but his wife is under our protection, and by extension, her son. You may not harm them. Allow them the dignity of exile.",male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, No one will get past her.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, Jessica!,male
STILGAR, So. He has come.,male
STILGAR," You are Outworlders, come for the spice. You take it, giving nothing in return.",male
STILGAR," I ask this: Do not seek our sietches or trespass in our lands. The desert was ours long before you came. Come and dig your spice. But when you have it, go back to this side of the Shield Wall. Leave the desert to the Fremen.",male
STILGAR, That is honorable.,male
STILGAR, This is the Duke’s son.,male
STILGAR, This is the boy I told you about. The chosen one. We can’t touch him.,male
STILGAR," Jamis, hold. That was a brave crossing they made in the path of Shai Hulud. He does not speak or act like a weakling. Nor did his father.",male
STILGAR, What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh?,male
STILGAR, Why didn’t you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?,male
STILGAR," Peace, woman! I judged hastily.",male
STILGAR," You will have your own maula pistol, when you’ve earned it.",male
STILGAR, Jamis! I have spoken. Be still.,male
STILGAR, You may not challenge a Sayyadina.,male
STILGAR, Jamis. Don’t do this. The night is fading.,male
STILGAR, The boy doesn’t know our rule. There can be no yielding under the amtal rule. Death is the test of it.,male
STILGAR, You are one of us now. A life for a life. Come with us to Sietch Tabr. The night is flown: We must travel under the sun.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, The thing must go.,male
REVEREND MOTHER MOHIAM, GET OUT.,male
GURNEY, They say: everybody here is addicted to it.,male
GURNEY, They say: it’s everywhere. In the food. In the air.,male
HAWAT, The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every year.,male
HAWAT, Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.,male
IDAHO, Treat them well. These are friends.,male
IDAHO, And there are hundreds of sietches.,male
IDAHO, Sire. Milord Duke.,male
IDAHO, I swear you’re taller.,male
IDAHO, I have so much to tell you.,male
IDAHO," For four weeks I lived with the Fremen, in a community called a sietch. Hidden in the desert. Stilgar, the leader of that sietch, has come with me to meet you, Sire.",male
IDAHO, Underground. Arrakis is full of caverns.,male
IDAHO, I’d say ten thousand people.,male
IDAHO," The Fremen watched me search for them for days. I never saw them. Finally they sent a warrior out to kill me. I’ll tell you, I’ve never been so close to dying. There are no finer fighters in the Imperium. They fight like demons.",male
IDAHO," Thank you, milord.",male
IDAHO, A crysknife. Sacred to his people.,male
IDAHO," HOLD! Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body’s moisture. We accept it in the spirit in which it is given.",male
IDAHO," This is for you. A paracompass. The moons here have magnetic fields, so a simple compass needle won’t point north. It takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out.",male
IDAHO," And stillsuits, and sand compactors ...all kinds of ingenious things.",male
IDAHO, That’s a sand compactor.,male
IDAHO," I do. They’re fierce, but loyal. Attuned to the desert. Part of it. It’s part of them. Wait ‘til you see. It’s beautiful out there.",male
IDAHO, Kynes!,male
IDAHO, Will you tell the Great Houses of the Landsraad how we were betrayed? How the best of them was murdered here?,male
IDAHO, The Emperor sent us here to die.,male
IDAHO, Paul. I’m so sorry. Your father...,male
IDAHO, She’s found us a place to hide. And friends to watch over us.,male
IDAHO," I listened on the combat channels. Gurney gave ‘em hell at Arrakeen Landing, but lost the day. They must have landed ten legions. Hundreds of ships. There were Sardaukar with them. At least two battalions.",male
IDAHO," You cross swords with a Sardaukar, you know it.",male
STILGAR, That is all I have to say to you.,male
STILGAR, The boy is young. He can learn. Liet favors him. He may have sanctuary. But the woman is untrained and too old to learn our ways.,male
STILGAR," Back, you dogs! She’ll cut my throat!",male
STILGAR, Chani. Take charge of the newcomers. See that they are safe on the journey.,male
STILGAR, Is he toying with him?,male
KYNES, My Lord Duke. Welcome to Arrakis.,male
KYNES," They are of Fremen make. The best. With your permission, Sire, I must check the integrity of your suits.",male
KYNES," A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system. It cools the body, and recycles the water lost to sweat and other bodily fluids. Without one of these you wouldn’t survive two hours, even in the morning. Your body’s movements provide the power.",male
KYNES, Your desert boots are fitted slip- fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that?,male
KYNES, I am accepted in both sietch and village. But I remain an out- worlder in the Emperor’s service. Now. Come and see the spice sands on which your livelihood depends.,male
KYNES, You wouldn’t want to go down out there. It’s worm territory.,male
KYNES, That’s one of your harvesters.,male
KYNES," A sand wave moving toward the crawler. Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack. If you are patient, we should see one.",male
KYNES, Always. They’re drawn by rhythmic noises.,male
KYNES, A shield’s a death sentence in the desert. They attract the worms and drive them into a killing frenzy.,male
KYNES, A big one. You have good eyes.,male
KYNES," Unlisted flight, Imperium business. Wormsign north and east of you three point seven kilometers.",male
KYNES, They’ll call the carryall to lift the crawler. They’ll harvest right up to the last minute.,male
KYNES, Short of atomics? No.,male
KYNES, Crew of twenty-one.,male
KYNES, Contact in two minutes.,male
KYNES, Bless the Maker and His Water. Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world and keep the world for His people.,male
KYNES," All I can report is what I saw. That carryall was not sabotaged, just old. The desert isn’t kind to equipment.",male
KYNES, I’m not here to take your part. Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.,male
KYNES, It’s not safe for you here.,male
KYNES, I am commanded to say nothing. To see nothing.,male
KYNES, God created Arrakis to test the faithful.,male
KYNES, People I trust.,male
KYNES, My title is hollow. The Emperor forbids me to say anything at all.,male
KYNES, We have to get inside. There’s a storm coming.,male
KYNES," Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors? Shamir, coffee service, please.",male
KYNES, Do you know what this place is? It’s an old Ecological Testing Station. They were meant to tame the planet. Free the water locked beneath the sands. Arrakis could be a paradise. The work had begun. But then we discovered the spice! And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away.,male
KYNES," Thank you, Tanat.",male
KYNES, If they believed me...there would be general warfare between the Great Houses and the Emperor.,male
KYNES," You’d make a play for the throne? You’re a lost boy, hiding in a hole in the ground.",male
KYNES, Superstition.,male
KYNES, Come!,male
KYNES," Follow the arrows. You’ll find a desert-rigged thopter ready to fly. That storm out there’s your best shot. Above five thousand meters, they’re mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top. You might just live.",male
KYNES, It only seats two. I’ll get to the next station and report this attack to the Landsraad.,male
KYNES, I’m Fremen. The desert’s my home.,male
KYNES, Good luck!,male
KYNES, I serve only one master. His name is Shai-Hulud!,male
KYNES," In the open desert you wear these nose plugs and this filter across your face. In good working order, your suit won’t lose more than a thimbleful of water a day.",male
KYNES," Let’s have a look at you, lad.",male
KYNES, You’ve worn a stillsuit before?,male
KYNES," A rich spice bed, by the color. If you get a little higher you’ll have a better view.",male
KYNES," There, you see the spotter aircraft, looking for wormsign.",male
KYNES, Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning! Acknowledge.,male
KYNES, There.,male
CHANI, I knew you couldn’t stay the hell away.,female
LETO, Lisan al-Gaib.,male
GURNEY," Now worlds away, in stranger skies, They call no more, they call no more.",male
GURNEY," I remember perfume on a silken veil, Lovers’ arms pale against the dusk...",male
GURNEY," Now worlds away, those winsome ladies They call no more, they call no more.",male
GURNEY," I remember garrisons of old campaigners, Years washed with weariness and wine... Now worlds away, the wars forgotten...",male
GURNEY," They call no more, they call no more.",male
KYNES," Above five thousand meters, they’re mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top. You might just live.",male
STILGAR, Do not run. You will only waste your bodies’ water.,male
STILGAR, Hold!,male
CHANI, They say you are the Mahdi. But you look like any boy.,female
CHANI, You chose the hardest way up. Follow me.,female
CHANI, This crysknife was given to me by my great aunt. It’s made out of a tooth of Shai-Hulud. The great sandworm. This will be an honor for you to die holding it.,female
