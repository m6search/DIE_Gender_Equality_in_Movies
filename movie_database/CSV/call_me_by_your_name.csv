PERLMAN, I’m think they’re closed for summer vacation. Try Crema.,male
PERLMAN," Pesca, ciliege, albicocche... (peaches, cherries, apricots...)",male
PERLMAN," The word apricot comes from the Arabic - it’s like the words “algebra”, “alchemy”, and “alcohol”. It derives from an Arabic noun combined with the Arabic article ‘al-’ before it. The origin of our Italian ‘albicocca’ was ‘al-barquq’...",male
PERLMAN, Ah?,male
PERLMAN, How so?,male
PERLMAN, Passes with flying colors.,male
PERLMAN," Ah, frizzante! (Sparkling wine!)",male
PERLMAN, I don’t think he’s arrogant. I think Oliver is shy.,male
PERLMAN," I’m telling you, he’s just shy. You’ll grow to like him.",male
PERLMAN," Elio, play something.",male
PERLMAN, Perchè non ti va? (Why don’t you feel like it?),male
PERLMAN," You are? Good. I think this needs firming up. Your insights are persuasive, but..",male
PERLMAN, And why didn’t you?,male
PERLMAN," I just heard from the people in Sirmione, they say they’ve come up with something. I’m going there today, would you like to go with me?",male
PERLMAN, On condition that you remain silent.,male
PERLMAN, Nothing is being dug up. It’s what has been brought up - out of the water.,male
PERLMAN," Guido io oggi, non ti preoccupare. Non fare quella facci Anchise! Prenditi il pomeriggio libero. (I think i will drive myself today. Anchise, don’t be upset! Take the afternoon off)",male
PERLMAN," What’s going on, boys? Oliver, come sit up front and be my navigator.",male
PERLMAN, The ship went down in 1827 on the way to the villa of Count Lechi...,male
PERLMAN, Who would like to go for a swim before we head back?,male
PERLMAN, Are you going too?,male
PERLMAN, How about a drink to celebrate the day?,male
PERLMAN, It must be over there...,male
PERLMAN," Elly-belly, you know you can talk to us about anything?",male
PERLMAN, Must be tired then. Or were you playing poker too?,male
PERLMAN, Several hundred color slides of our boxer and the others like him arrived yesterday from Berlin. We should start cataloging them. That will keep us busy until lunch I imagine. Grow up. I’ll see you at midnight.,male
PERLMAN, Beautiful aren’t they?,male
PERLMAN," Because these are more Hellenistic than the fifth-century Athenian, most likely sculpted under the influence of the greatest sculptor in antiquity: Praxiteles.  Their muscles are film- look at his stomach for example- and yet never a straight body in these statues, they are all curves, sometimes impossibly curved and so nonchalant, hence their ageless ambiguity.  As if they are daring you to desire them.",male
PERLMAN, Okay...,male
PERLMAN," No misbehaving tonight. When I tell you to play, then play! You’re too old not to accept people as they are. What’s wrong with them? I don’t think it’s very attractive of you to call them ‘Sonny and Cher’ behind their backs...",male
PERLMAN, ...and then accept gifts from them. Is it because they’re gay or because they’re ridiculous? Is that it? I hope not. And if you know as much about economics when you’re Mounir’s age you’ll be a very wise man indeed and a credit to me. Now get into this.,male
PERLMAN, Later.,male
PERLMAN, Oliver told me he has to go to Bergamo for a couple of days to do some research at the university there before he leaves.  He would then fly home directly from Linate.,male
PERLMAN, So? Welcome home. Did Oliver enjoy the trip?,male
PERLMAN, You two had a nice friendship.,male
PERLMAN," You’re too smart not to know how rare, how special, what you two had was.",male
PERLMAN," “Parce-que c’etait lui, parce-que c’etait moi.” (Because he was he, because I was I)",male
PERLMAN," Intelligent? He was more than intelligent. What you two had had everything and nothing to do with intelligence. He was good, and you were both lucky to have found each other, because you too are good.",male
PERLMAN," I’m sure he’d say the same thing about you, which flatters the two of you.",male
PERLMAN, I don’t think she does.,male
PERLMAN, You caught us while in the process of choosing the new you for next summer..,male
PERLMAN, Mazel Tov!,male
PERLMAN, And Happy Hannukah!,male

ANNELLA, Sono le otto passate! Noi ci mettiamo a tavola. (It’s eight o’clock! We’ll sit down),female
ANNELLA," Meanwhile, we’ll have to put up with him for six long weeks. Won’t we?",female
ANNELLA, Mio piccino! (My little one!) Può togliere i piatti di Mr. Oliver? (You can remove Mr. Oliver’s place setting away?),female
ANNELLA, Pourquoi tu ne vas pas à Moscazzano avec les autres? (Why not to Moscazzano with the others?),female
ANNELLA," Go see your friends. Go out. Do something. Ne reste pas là comme une araignée sur le mur, mon chéri! (Don’t just be a spider on the wall, darling!) You’re spoiling everyone’s fun.",female
ANNELLA, Elio!,female
ANNELLA," Try later, what?",female
ANNELLA, Have you seen my Heptameron?,female
ANNELLA," This is in German, but I’ll translate: Ein gut aus sehender junger Ritter ist wahnsinnig verliebt in eine Prinzessin. Sie auch ist in ihn verliebt. “...A handsome young knight is madly in love with a princess. She too is in love with him...",female
ANNELLA," Amore, è il compromesso storico! (Darling, I think it's the historic compromise...)",female
ANNELLA," Ma che c’entra? Sei matta? Sei una stronza! (What's that got to do with it? You're mad, darling.)",female

ANNELLA, And don’t forget Mounier and Isaac are coming for dinner tonight.,female
ANNELLA, I want you to wear the shirt they sent you from Miami.  It will make them happy,female
ANNELLA," Oh, maybe Elio could go with him? It would be nice for them to get away for a couple of days before Oliver leaves.  What do you think?",female
ANNELLA, E questo? (This one?),female
ANNELLA, Why aren’t you here? When are you coming?,female
ANNELLA, And he is a she!,female
ANNELLA," Oh, Oliver that’s wonderful!",female
ANNELLA," Darling, we are going to let you speak with Elio now. Congratulations, again...",female
ANNELLA, Elio... Elio?,female
OLIVER, Hi.,male
OLIVER, Later. I’ll have to pass. Can you make my excuses to your mother?,male
OLIVER, Big time.,male
OLIVER, Good. Are we far from the town? I need to open a bank account.,male
OLIVER, Is that your orchard?,male
OLIVER," I know myself. If I have three, I’ll have a fourth, and more.",male
OLIVER, What does one do around here?,male
OLIVER," What do you do in the winter, then? Don’t tell me: wait for summer, right?",male
OLIVER, Christmas?,male
OLIVER," I am from a small town in New England. I know what its like to be the odd Jew out.(Beat) And what else do you do here in summer, besides this?",male
OLIVER, I beg to differ.,male
OLIVER, The word is not actually an Arabic word.,male
OLIVER," It’s a long story, so bear with me, Pro. Many Latin words are derived from the Greek. In the case of ‘apricot’, however, it’s the other way around. Here the Greek takes over from Latin. The Latin word was praecoquum, from pre-coquere, pre- cook, to ripen early, as in precocious, meaning premature. The Byzantines - to go on - borrowed praecox, and it became prekokkia or berikokki, which is finally how the Arabs must have inherited it as al-barquq.",male
OLIVER," Here, let me make it better. Relax.",male
OLIVER," You’re stiff as a board. You’re made of knots. Come here, feel this...",male
OLIVER, Why aren’t you with the others at the river?,male
OLIVER, Me too. We might have the same one.,male
OLIVER, Let’s go now.,male
OLIVER, I’m going to change. What about you?,male
OLIVER, See you downstairs!,male
OLIVER, Elio! What are you doing?,male
OLIVER, No you’re not.,male
OLIVER, About?,male
OLIVER, So you won’t tell me?,male
OLIVER, So he won’t tell me.  In that case I’m going with your mom.,male
OLIVER, Just play it again.,male
OLIVER," Hated it? Just play it, will you?",male
OLIVER, The same one.,male
OLIVER, You changed it. What did you do to it? Is it Bach?,male
OLIVER," Just play it again, please!",male
OLIVER, Can’t you just play the Bach the way Bach wrote it?,male
OLIVER, Forget I asked.,male
OLIVER," Go on, I’m okay with criticism.",male
OLIVER, I’m okay with firming up - I’m okay with paradox. Back to the drawing board.,male
OLIVER, Are you sleeping?,male
OLIVER," Just listen to this drivel: “For the early Greeks, Heidegger contends, this underlying hidden- ness is constitutive of the way beings are, not only in relation to themselves but also to other entities generally. In other words, they do not construe hidden- ness merely or primarily in terms of entities' relation to human beings.”",male
OLIVER, That’s the kindest thing anyone’s said to me in months.,male
OLIVER," Yes, kind.",male
OLIVER, Better to have tried and failed...,male
OLIVER, Try again later.,male
OLIVER, I’d like that very much.,male
OLIVER," Silent as in too many opinions on things, or silent as in Security: not telling anybody what fabulous things have been dug up?",male
OLIVER, Are you trying to make me like her?,male

OLIVER," Don’t play at being the good host, just don’t.",male
OLIVER, Elio!,male
OLIVER," No Prof, I have to work.",male
OLIVER, That would be great.,male
OLIVER," The meaning of the river flowing is not that all things are changing so that we cannot encounter them twice, but that some things stay the same only by changing.",male
OLIVER, About the knight who doesn’t know whether to speak or die? You told me already.,male
OLIVER," Well, does he or doesn’t he?",male
OLIVER, So does he speak?,male
OLIVER," That figures. Listen, I need to pick up something in town.",male
OLIVER, Let’s go together.,male
OLIVER," Why, have you got anything better to do?",male
OLIVER, So let’s go.,male
OLIVER, I fell the other day on the way back and scraped myself pretty badly. Anchise insisted on applying me some sort of witch’s brew. He also fixed the bike for me.,male
OLIVER, You want to try one?,male
OLIVER, I don’t.,male
OLIVER, Is there anything you don’t know? I never heard of the Battle of Piave.,male
OLIVER, You know more than anyone around here.,male
OLIVER, What things that matter?,male
OLIVER, Why are you telling me all this?,male
OLIVER, Because you thought I should know.,male
OLIVER, Are you saying what I think you’re saying?,male
OLIVER, Wait for me here. Don’t go away.,male
OLIVER, They’ve mixed up my pages and now they have to retype the whole thing. So I have nothing to work on this afternoon. Which sets me back a whole day. Damn!,male
OLIVER, I’m going to pretend you never did.,male
OLIVER," Look, we can’t talk about such things, we really can’t.",male
OLIVER, It's freezing cold!,male
OLIVER, I like the way you say things. Why are you always putting yourself down?,male
OLIVER, Are you so scared of what others think? Or what I think?,male
OLIVER," What? This? Us, you mean?",male
OLIVER, Better now?,male
OLIVER, We can’t do this - I know myself. So far we’ve behaved. We’ve been good. Neither of us has done anything to feel ashamed of. Let’s keep it that way. I want to be good.,male
OLIVER, Just don’t.,male
OLIVER, Elio! Where are you?,male
OLIVER, I guess. The ancients said it never hurts to be bled from time to time.,male
OLIVER, My bubbe. She did it all the time to us.,male
OLIVER, You don’t ever wear it?,male
OLIVER, I guess that fits your mom...,male
OLIVER, I hope not.,male
OLIVER, I think so. Just a bit of a nose bleed.,male
OLIVER, Did you enjoy yourself last night?,male
OLIVER, They’re amazing. But these are far more... sensual.,male
OLIVER, What's the time?,male
OLIVER," (in his halting Italian) Mafalda, non sarò con voi a cena stasera. (I won’t be home for dinner this evening).",male
OLIVER, I’m glad you came. I thought you had changed your mind.,male
OLIVER, Sometimes.,male
OLIVER, Me too.,male
OLIVER," Come, sit.",male
OLIVER, What are you doing?,male
OLIVER, That’s a start.,male
OLIVER," Off, and off, and off, and off...",male
OLIVER, Nothing to worry about.,male

OLIVER, Are you going to hold last night against me?,male
OLIVER, Take your trunks off.,male
OLIVER," I’m going to town, I have to collect my typed up pages. Later I'd like to show them to you, Professor.",male
OLIVER, So.. Later!,male
OLIVER, Something wrong?,male
OLIVER, Aren’t you sick of me?,male
OLIVER, Do you have any idea how glad I am we slept together?,male
OLIVER, It’s just like you not to know. I don’t want you to regret any of it. I don’t want either of us to have to pay one way or another.,male
OLIVER, I didn’t mean that.,male
OLIVER, I’d kiss you if I could.,male
OLIVER, I was looking everywhere for you.. What are you doing up here?,male
OLIVER, I wish everyone were as sick as you. Want to see sick?,male
OLIVER, The peach juice helps a lot. Want to try it?,male
OLIVER, Then let go.,male
OLIVER, I did. At least I tried.,male
OLIVER," Once, when we were playing volleyball, I touched you... Just as a way of showing... I liked you. The way you reacted made me feel I’d almost molested you. I decided to keep my distance. I come out here every night and just sit for hours.",male
OLIVER, I know what you thought.,male
OLIVER, Listen!,male
OLIVER, This song!,male

ELIO, I saw her naked on a night swim. She has a great body.,male
ELIO, This is my spot. All mine. I come here to read. I can’t begin to tell you the number of books I’ve read here.,male
ELIO, I come here to escape the known world.,male
ELIO, Where did you learn to do that?,male
ELIO, See if Oliver doesn’t think I look like a scarecrow in it.  I’ll model it for you.,male
ELIO, So you do smoke?,male
ELIO, You’re hurting me.,male
OLIVER," So, this is usually your room..",male
OLIVER," Thanks, buddy.",male
OLIVER, What do you do?,male
OLIVER, Courtesy Philology 101.,male
OLIVER, Here. Feel it? He should relax more.,male
OLIVER, Want to go for a swim? Just the two of us?,male
OLIVER, I can’t believe you changed it again.,male
OLIVER, Does this make any sense to you? Not to me. Nor to your dad.,male
OLIVER," Not bad, right?",male
OLIVER, World War II? Did the Allies fight near here?,male
OLIVER, You’re making things very difficult for me.,male
OLIVER, I think we should go.,male
OLIVER, I should make sure it doesn’t get infected.,male
OLIVER, Was it my fault?,male
OLIVER, Are you going to be okay?,male
OLIVER, You okay?,male
OLIVER, Does this make you happy? You aren’t going to have a nosebleed are you?,male
OLIVER, You sure you want this?,male
OLIVER, Can I kiss you?,male
OLIVER, Call me by your name and I’ll call you by mine.,male
OLIVER, Sit down.,male
OLIVER," Well, this is promising. You’re hard again. Good.",male
OLIVER, What have you done?,male
OLIVER, Is this what I think it is?,male
OLIVER," You tried out the plant kingdom? Next will be minerals? You’re rejecting the animal kingdom already? That would be me, I suppose.",male
OLIVER, Now may I taste it?,male
OLIVER, Li ho visti a New York l’anno scorso. Richard Butler.. spettacolo! (I saw them in New York last year. Richard Butler... awesome!),male
MAFALDA," Lasci fare a me, Signore. (Let me)",female
MAFALDA, Che muvi star! (What a movie star!),female

PERLMAN, It’s amazing that today in Israel and many Arab countries the fruit is referred to by a totally different name: ‘mishmish’.,male
PERLMAN, Before you leave we'll certainly find the time to go over these revisions.,male
PERLMAN," When you least expect it, Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot. Just remember: I am here. Right now you may not want to feel anything. Perhaps you never wished to feel anything. And perhaps it’s not to me that you’ll want to speak about these things. But feel something you obviously did.",male
PERLMAN," Look - you had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, to pray that their sons land on their feet. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it. And if there is a flame, don’t snuff it out. Don’t be brutal with it.",male
PERLMAN," We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!",male
PERLMAN, Have I spoken out of turn?,male
PERLMAN," Then let me say one more thing. It will clear the air. I may have come close, but I never had what you two had. Something always held me back or stood in the way. How you live your life is your business. Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there’s sorrow. Pain. Don’t kill it and with it the joy you’ve felt.",male
PERLMAN," We may never speak about this again. But I hope you’ll never hold it against me that we did. I will have been a terrible father if, one day, you’d want to speak to me and felt that the door was shut, or not sufficiently open.",male
MARZIA," Sicuramente è meglio di quello dell’anno scorso, ti ricordi? (He’s certainly a big improvement from last year, do you remember?)",female
MARZIA, You should relax more.,female
MARZIA," Lo vuole a tutti i costi, eh. (She’s really after him, that’s clear.)",female
MARZIA, Tu n'es pas avec moi parce que tu es fâché contre Chiara? (You’re not with me because you’re angry with Chiara?),female

MARZIA, Tu es désespérant. (You’re hopeless.),female
MARZIA, Sei un coglione. (Tu n'es qu'un crétin) Donne-moi une cigarette. (Give me a cigarette.),female
MARZIA, Je ne sais pas... Les gens qui lisent sont cachottiers. Ils cachent ce qu'ils sont vraiment. Les gens qui cachent n'aiment pas toujours ce qu'ils sont. (I don’t know.. People who read are hiders. They hide who they are. People who hide don’t always like who they are.),female
MARZIA, Parfois. Pas toi? (Sometimes. Don’t you?),female
MARZIA," Non, pas avec toi. Ou si, peut- être, un petit peu. (No, not from you. Or maybe, yes, a bit.)",female
MARZIA, Tu sais très bien ce que je veux dire. (You know exactly like what.),female
MARZIA, Pourquoi? Parce que je pense que tu peux me faire souffrir,female
MARZIA, Buongiorno Mafalda!,female
MARZIA,,female
MARZIA, Tu as disparu pendant trois jours. (You’ve been gone three days.),female

ANCHISE, (I straightened the wheel. It took some doing. I also put air in the tires),male
MARZIA, (Turn around. Don’t stare at me.),female
MARZIA," Tu lis vraiment autant que ça ? Je veux direi: moi aussi, j'aime lire, mais je ne le dis à personne. (Do you really read that much? Don’t get me wrong. I like to read, too. But I don’t tell anyone.)",female
MARZIA," Pas parce que tu cherches à blesser, mais parce que tu changes toujours d'avis, alors, on ne sait donc jamais à quoi s'en tenir. Tu m'effraies. (Not that you mean to hurt anyone, but because you’re always changing your mind, so no one knows where to find you. You scare me.)",female
MARZIA, Tu m'embrasses encore? (Kiss me again?),female
MARZIA, Comme tu es dur! (You’re so hard.) Embrasse-moi encore. (Kiss me again.),female
MARZIA, Am I your girl? (Est-ce que je suis ta copine?),female
MARZIA, How are you?,female
MARZIA, I'm sorry you feel so bad. I just wanted to tell you that I'm not mad at you. I love you. (Je suis désolée que tu sois si malheureux. Je voulais juste te dire que je ne t'en veux pas. Je t'aime.),female
MARZIA, On reste amis? (Friends.),female
CHIARA, Dis-lui que je suis passée. (Tell him I came by.),female
CHIARA, Il danse très bien. (He dances great.),female
CHIARA," Tu veux jouer les entremetteurs? (What are you trying to do, fix us up?)",female
CHIARA, How is he? Will he live?,female
CHIARA, Really? I’ll be back in a minute. Don’t go anywhere.,female
CHIARA," Ça t'a fait mal ? Pourtant, tu as des pieds de paysan qui ne sentent rien. Paysan! (You felt that? You have peasant feet. They don’t feel things. Peasant!)",female
CHIARA, Doucement. Tu vas encore le faire saigner. (Easy. You’ll make him bleed again.),female
CHIARA, Qu’est-ce que j’en sais? (How would I know?),female
PERLMAN," There are four known sets of statues, after the Praxiteles originals. This fellow should be Number Three. The Emperor Hadrian had a pair, dug up at Tivoli, but one of the more philistine of the Farnese popes melted them down and had them recast as a particularly voluptuous Venus that was traded to Napoleon later on.",male
ANNELLA," ...obwohl es so scheint, als sei sie sich nicht vollig ihrer eigenen Liebe bewusst. ...though she seems not to be entirely aware of it. Despite the friendship... Freundschaft... that blossoms between them, or perhaps because of that very friendship, the young knight finds himself so humbled and speechless that he is totally unable to bring up the subject of his love. One day he asks the princess point-blank: Ich bitte euch ratet mir was besser ist... reden oder sterben. ‘Is it better to speak or die’.",female
MARCO," E così siamo arrivati al pentapartito, con Craxi al governo... (So we got to the government of Bettino Craxi).",male
MARCO, Lasciami parlare. Abbiamo cinque partiti che non fanno altro che discutere. (Let me speak. We have five parties that do nothing but fight.),male
MARCO, E vogliamo parlare della morte di Bunuel? Un genio assoluto! (Why don't we talk about the death of Buñuel? He was a genius.) Tu conosci Bunuel? (Know him?),male
MARCO, Il cinema è lo specchio della realtà. (Cinema is a mirror of reality).,male

ELENA," E allora fuma e stai zitto, w lasciali parlare, vorrei sapere cosa ne pensano loro. Annella tu che ne pensi? Il pentapartito! (Smoke and shut up! Let them speak, him, her... I'd like to know what they think too. Annella, what do you think? A 5-party government!)",female
ELENA," E lo dici così? E’ una tragedia! Annella, da quando hai ereditato questo posto sei cambiata... (Compromises are tragic. Annella, you've changed since you inherited this place.)",female
ELENA, E tu non dici niente? (Say something. You're resigned).,female
ELENA, Il cinema non può essere la risposta per tutto... (Cinema isn't the answer...),female
ELENA, Sentiamo che ha da dire lui. (Let's hear his opinion. Say something.),female

OLIVER," Well, I have some news for you. I got engaged.",male
OLIVER, I figured.,male
OLIVER, From the way your father spoke - he made me feel like a member of the family - almost like a son-in-law. You’re lucky. My father would have carted me off to a correctional facility.,male
OLIVER, (After a very long beat) Oliver.. I remember everything ...,male
