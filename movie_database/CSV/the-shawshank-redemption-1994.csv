D.A.," Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.",male
D.A., Samuel Norton? We have a warrant for your arrest! Open up!,male
ANDY," It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno.",male
ANDY, I told her I would not grant one.,male
ANDY, If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset.,male
ANDY, She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin.,male
ANDY," I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited.",male
ANDY, I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them.,male
ANDY, Yes. I did.,male
ANDY, No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce.,male
ANDY," I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point.",male
ANDY, Yes. It does.,male
ANDY, Yes. It does.,male
ANDY, Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.,male
ANDY, It's the truth.,male
ANDY," Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found.",male
ANDY, Hadn't planned on it.,male
ANDY, What was his name?,male
ANDY, I was wondering if anyone knew his name.,male
ANDY, Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne.,male
ANDY, How do you know that?,male
ANDY," I didn't, since you ask.",male
ANDY, What else have you heard?,male
ANDY, What do you think?,male
ANDY, I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.,male
ANDY, I wonder if you could get me a rock- hammer?,male
ANDY, You make your customers' motives a part of your business?,male
ANDY," Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks.",male
ANDY," Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite.",male
ANDY," I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale.",male
ANDY, I have no enemies here.,male
ANDY, Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?,male
ANDY, Thanks for the advice.,male
ANDY," If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good.",male
ANDY, You'll know when you see the rock- hammer.,male
ANDY, Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.,male
ANDY, Ten it is.,male
ANDY, Oh?,male
ANDY," I understand. Thank you, Mr...?",male
ANDY, Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you.,male
ANDY," You get this in your eyes, it blinds you.",male
ANDY, Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife?,male
ANDY," What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to hamstring you?",male
ANDY," Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money.",male
ANDY," If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars.",male
ANDY, Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent.,male
ANDY," It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself.",male
ANDY," Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example...",male
ANDY," ...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge. I'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers, if that seems fair.",male
ANDY, I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion.,male
ANDY, No thanks. I gave up drinking.,male
ANDY, Chess. Now there's a game of kings. Civilized...strategic...,male
ANDY, Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting a board together.,male
ANDY," We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I'd like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz... the opposing side in limestone.",male
ANDY, Years I've got. What I don't have are the rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim.,male
ANDY, Not yet. I suppose I should.,male
ANDY, I suppose we are.,male
ANDY," I'm innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here.",male
ANDY, Innocent?,male
ANDY, I know. I've seen it three times this month already.,male
ANDY, Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?,male
ANDY, Weeks?,male
ANDY, I know. I've seen it three times this month already.,male
ANDY, Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?,male
ANDY, Weeks?,male
ANDY, They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with.,male
ANDY, Okay.,male
ANDY," Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose.",male
ANDY," Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. In fact, I understand the bite- reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar.",male
ANDY, Good evening.,male
ANDY," Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh.",male
ANDY," John. Chapter 8, verse 12.",male
ANDY, It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine.,male
ANDY," It's very pretty, sir.",male
ANDY," No, sir. Not especially.",male
ANDY," Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?",male
ANDY, I've been reassigned to you.,male
ANDY, Brooks? How long have you been librarian?,male
ANDY," In all that time, have you ever had an assistant?",male
ANDY, So why now? Why me?,male
ANDY, I see. Well. Why don't we have a seat and talk it over?,male
ANDY, What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on your pay?,male
ANDY, He was right. You don't want your money in a bank.,male
ANDY," What's that gonna earn you? Two and a half, three percent a year? We can do a lot better than that. So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do you want to send your kids? Harvard? Yale?",male
ANDY," I wouldn't say ""friends."" I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have.",male
ANDY, Maybe it can do more than that.,male
ANDY, Ask the warden for funds.,male
ANDY, I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them.,male
ANDY," Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.",male
ANDY," Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it?",male
ANDY," See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off.",male
ANDY," Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s?",male
ANDY," Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that. Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood?",male
ANDY," Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man.",male
ANDY," You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people.",male
ANDY, Take it easy. You'll be all right.,male
ANDY," I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all.",male
ANDY, P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings.,male
ANDY, Red!,male
ANDY," That's real pretty, Red. Nice work.",male
ANDY, What is all this?,male
ANDY," Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... "" This is two hundred dollars.",male
ANDY," Only took six years. From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one.",male
ANDY, They broke the door down before I could take requests.,male
ANDY, Easiest time I ever did.,male
ANDY, I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all.,male
ANDY," The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red?",male
ANDY, Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget.,male
ANDY," That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope.",male
ANDY, Like Brooks did?,male
ANDY, You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went.,male
ANDY, You gonna play something?,male
ANDY, ...Stevenson. Next?,male
ANDY," Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right behind you.",male
ANDY, Dumas. You boys'll like that one. It's about a prison break.,male
ANDY," Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like always.",male
ANDY, Very nice.,male
ANDY, What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place.,male
ANDY," That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back...",male
ANDY," Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire.",male
ANDY, I thought you had more faith in me than that.,male
ANDY," Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden.",male
ANDY, Peter Stevens.,male
ANDY," The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.",male
ANDY, A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn't exist...except on paper.,male
ANDY," Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination.",male
ANDY," It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.",male
ANDY," I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that?",male
ANDY, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.,male
ANDY," Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession. What I mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief. Maybe you should try something else.",male
ANDY, Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that?,male
ANDY," I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.",male
ANDY," That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing half-assed.",male
ANDY, Well. You've come to the right place then.,male
ANDY," ...and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! """,male
ANDY, That's right.,male
ANDY, Well?,male
ANDY, May not be as bad as you think.,male
ANDY, We'll see how the score comes out.,male
ANDY, Sir?,male
ANDY, I think he's telling the truth.,male
ANDY," It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.",male
ANDY, They'd have his last known address. Names of relatives... Well it's a chance. isn't it? How can you be so obtuse?,male
ANDY, Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club will have his old time cards! W-2s with his name on them!,male
ANDY," Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money!",male
ANDY," I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all.",male
ANDY," What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life?",male
ANDY, I'm done. It stops right now. Get H&R Block to declare your income.,male
ANDY," My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. She was beautiful. I loved her. But I guess I couldn't show it enough. I killed her, Red.",male
ANDY," No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess.",male
ANDY," It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has. Think you'll ever get out of here?",male
ANDY, Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo.,male
ANDY," Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where I'd like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things.",male
ANDY, You underestimate yourself.,male
ANDY," Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel and that boat...I don't think it's too much to want.",male
ANDY," You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.",male
ANDY," Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?",male
ANDY, One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my,male
ANDY, You'll just have to pry up that rock and see.,male
ANDY," Just about done, sir.",male
ANDY," Just about done, sir.",male
ANDY, My name is Peter Stevens. I've come to close out some accounts.,male
ANDY, Thank you. I'm sure I will.,male
ANDY, Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail?,male
ANDY, You look like a man who knows how to get things.,male
D.A., What was your response?,male
D.A.," (refers to his notes) I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno. Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors.",male
D.A., What happened after you and your wife argued?,male
D.A., Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club.,male
D.A., With what intention?,male
D.A., You had a gun with you?,male
D.A.," When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them?",male
D.A.," Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 caliber divorce, wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean? And then you shot her lover!",male
D.A.," Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?",male
D.A.," I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think the jury heard that.",male
D.A., Does what?,male
D.A.," On that, sir, we are in accord...",male
D.A.," You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found. So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That's also rather convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?",male
D.A.," Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence?",male
D.A., Byron Hadley?,male
D.A., The man you had recently discovered was her lover. (Andy nods) Did you follow her?,male
D.A., You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders took place. That's rather convenient.,male
D.A.," I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think about that, think about this...",male
D.A.," A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider!",male
D.A.," Four bullets per victim! Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra bullet per lover...right in the head. (a few JURORS shiver) I'm done talking. You people are all decent, God-fearing Christian folk. You know what to do.",male
D.A.," You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say will be used against you in court...",male
RED," Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it.",male
RED," There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet.",male
RED," Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice.",male
RED, High roller. Who's your horse?,male
RED, That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any takers?,male
RED, Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake half a pack. Any takers?,male
RED," C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong? Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed.",male
RED," Give him some'a your cigarettes instead, cheap bastard.",male
RED, The wife-killin' banker.,male
RED, I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it?,male
RED," Hell, you'll fit right in, then. Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy?",male
RED, People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true?,male
RED, Ain't made up my mind yet.,male
RED, I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish.,male
RED, What is it and why?,male
RED," If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object.",male
RED, Rocks.,male
RED, So?,male
RED," Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull?",male
RED, No? Just wait.,male
RED," Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you.",male
RED, That comes free. But you understand my concern.,male
RED, Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? I miss the joke. What's so funny?,male
RED, What's this item usually go for?,male
RED," My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even.",male
RED, I'll see what I can do. But it's a waste of money.,male
RED," Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.",male
RED, Red. The name's Red.,male
RED, Dufresne.,male
RED, Crying shame. Some folks got it awful bad.,male
RED, God damn it...,male
RED, King me.,male
RED, ...and totally fuckin' inexplicable. Hate that game.,male
RED, You come to the right place. I'm the man who can get things.,male
RED, That'd take you years.,male
RED, How's that rock-hammer workin' out anyway? Scratch your name on your wall yet?,male
RED," Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be friends, ain't we?",male
RED, I ask a question? Why'd you do it?,male
RED, Murder. Same as you.,male
RED, The only guilty man in Shawshank.,male
RED, Here's the good part. Bugs come out of the walls to get his ass.,male
RED, Sure. What do you want?,male
RED, No problem. Take a few weeks.,male
RED," Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman.",male
RED, Sure. What do you want?,male
RED, No problem. Take a few weeks.,male
RED," Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman.",male
RED, I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.,male
RED, Man likes to play chess. Let's get him some rocks.,male
RED, Horse apple.,male
RED," No, horse shit. Petrified.",male
RED," Makin' yourself some friends, Andy.",male
RED," Got you out of the laundry, didn't it?",male
RED, What the hell's going on?,male
RED," No. We'll handle this. Ain't that right, Brooks? Just settle down and we'll talk about it, okay?",male
RED, Why? What's Heywood done to you?,male
RED," Yeah, that's right. That's what everybody says.",male
RED, You've had worse from shaving. What'd you do to set him off?,male
RED," Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be long till you're squiring pretty young girls on your arm and telling 'em lies.",male
RED," Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing wrong with Brooksie. He's just institutionalized, that's all.",male
RED," Man's been here fifty years. This place is all he knows. In here, he's an important man, an educated man. A librarian. Out there, he's nothing but a used-up old con with arthritis in both hands. Couldn't even get a library card if he applied. You see what I'm saying?",male
RED," Believe what you want. These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's ""institutionalized.""",male
RED," Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and that's just what they take. Part that counts, anyway.",male
RED," He should'a died in here, goddamn it.",male
RED, Is that Jake?,male
RED, Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a crow. Neither was much to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what you can do for 'em. Amen.,male
RED," Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? I could'a swore they confiscated that stuff.",male
RED, Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't make much sense on the inside.,male
RED, Forget?,male
RED, Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place here. Better get used to the idea.,male
RED," Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I'm a changed man. No danger to society, that's the God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.",male
RED," Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When you say it like that...",male
RED," It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you.",male
RED, Not today.,male
RED," I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving.",male
RED, Maybe that should go under educational too.,male
RED, Nobody asked you.,male
RED," Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.",male
RED, Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from.,male
RED, It's clean as a virgin's whistle?,male
RED," Jesus. They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself.",male
RED," I'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- that trail's gonna lead to somebody.",male
RED, Who then?,male
RED, Who?,male
RED," Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?",male
RED, You can't just make a person up.,male
RED, Jesus. Did I say you were good? You're Rembrandt.,male
RED, Does it ever bother you?,male
RED, To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money instead of sheets.,male
RED," Ass in gear, son! You're putting us behind!",male
RED," That's crap, son. He's proud of you. Proud as a hen. We been friends a long time. I know him as good as anybody.",male
RED, Smart as they come. Used to be a banker on the outside.,male
RED, Murder.,male
RED," You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, boy, back to work...",male
RED, Andy?,male
RED," Like hell. You didn't pull the trigger, and you didn't convict him.",male
RED, Since '47. Going on nineteen years.,male
RED, Board of Education.,male
RED, Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt?,male
RED," Well, shit.",male
RED," That don't make you a murderer. Bad husband, maybe.",male
RED, Bad luck? Jesus.,male
RED, Sure. When I got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs.,male
RED, Zihuatanejo?,male
RED," Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on the outside. Been in here too long. I'm an institutional man now. Like old Brooks Hatlen was.",male
RED," Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who can get it for you. Out there, all you need are Yellow Pages. I wouldn't know where to begin. Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare me to death, somethin' that big.",male
RED," Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do that to yourself! Talking shitty pipedreams! Mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's the way it is!",male
RED, Andy?,male
RED, Lots of hayfields there.,male
RED, What? What's buried there?,male
RED," I tell you, the man was talkin' crazy. I'm worried, I truly am.",male
RED, Every man's got a breaking point.,male
RED, Yeah. Sure. That's right.,male
RED, Well what?,male
RED," No sir, he didn't!",male
RED," It's shit, it's shit, oh my God it's shit...",male
RED," I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's see now. You know, come to think of it, I have no idea what that means.",male
RED," I know what you think it means. Me, I think it's a made-up word, a poli- tician's word. A word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?",male
RED," Not a day goes by I don't feel regret, and not because I'm in here or because you think I should.",male
RED, Sir? Restroom break sir?,male
RED, Yes sir. That I am.,male
RED, Things got different out here.,male
RED, Guess the world moved on.,male
RED," McNary, Texas?",male
RED, I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.,male
RED," There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason.",male
RED," Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & Roebuck.",male
RED," So when Andy Dufresne came to me in and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. And it wasn't.",male
RED, Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin'.,male
RED," On the outside, he'd been vice- president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then.",male
RED," I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.",male
RED," The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you...",male
RED," ...and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.",male
RED," Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be?",male
RED," It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne...",male
RED, I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now.,male
RED, The boys always go fishin' with first-timers...and they don't quit till they reel someone in.,male
RED," His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound...",male
RED," I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start.",male
RED, He was a man who adapted fast.,male
RED," Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars...",male
RED," When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there.",male
RED, That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination.,male
RED, Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.,male
RED," I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.",male
RED, He never said who did it...but we all knew.,male
RED," Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine.",male
RED," Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.",male
RED, The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight them off... sometimes not.,male
RED," He always fought, that's what I remember. He fought because he knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time.",male
RED, Half the time it landed him in the infirmary...,male
RED," ...the other half, it landed him in solitary. Warden Norton's ""grain & drain"" vacation. Bread, water, and all the privacy you could want.",male
RED," And that's how it went for Andy. That was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him. And I also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him. But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be decided that...",male
RED," It was outdoor detail, and May is one damn fine month to be workin' outdoors.",male
RED, More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.,male
RED, Wouldn't you know it? Me and some fellas I know were among the names called.,male
RED," Only cost us a pack of smokes per man. I made my usual twenty percent, of course.",male
RED," And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49...",male
RED," ...wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.",male
RED, The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.,male
RED," We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men. We could'a been tarring the",male
RED," As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer.",male
RED," You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again...if only for a short while.",male
RED," Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth, and neither did his friends. What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life...",male
RED, Andy spent a month in traction.,male
RED, Bogs spent a week in the hole.,male
RED, Two things never happened again after that. The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...,male
RED," ...and Bogs never walked again. They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate. To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw.",male
RED," Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style...",male
RED," ...and by the week Andy was due back, we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till Rapture.",male
RED," Also got a big shipment in that week. Cigarettes, chewing gum, shoelaces, playing cards with naked ladies on 'em, you name it... ...and, of course, the most important item.",male
RED," Tossin' cells was just an excuse. Truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.",male
RED," So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said.",male
RED," And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers. But still he kept on.",male
RED," The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.",male
RED," Year after that, he did them all... including the warden's.",male
RED," Year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season...",male
RED, The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W- 2's.,male
RED," Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R Block. In fact, he got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.",male
RED," Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.",male
RED, And still he kept sending those letters...,male
RED," It never would have occurred to us, if not for Andy. It was his idea. We all agreed it was the right thing to do...",male
RED," I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid.",male
RED," I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away...and for the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free.",male
RED, It pissed the warden off something terrible.,male
RED, Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.,male
RED, Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing to the State Senate. Two letters a week instead of one.,male
RED," In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a dollar check. Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of dollars, just to shut him up.",male
RED, Those checks came once a year like clockwork.,male
RED," You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it. He made deals with book clubs, charity groups...he bought remaindered books by the pound...",male
RED," By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy had transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England.",male
RED," That was also the year Warden Norton instituted his famous ""Inside-Out"" program. You may remember reading about it. It made all the papers and got his picture in LIFE magazine.",male
RED, None of the inmates were invited to express their views...,male
RED," 'Course, Norton failed to mention to the press that ""bare minimum of expense"" is a fairly loose term. There are a hundred different ways to skim off the top. Men, materials, you name it. And, oh my Lord, how the money rolled in...",male
RED," And behind every shady deal, behind every dollar earned...",male
RED," ...there was Andy, keeping the books.",male
RED, Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in on a two year stretch for B&E. Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.,male
RED," Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky as hell...",male
RED, We liked him immediately.,male
RED," As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl...",male
RED, Maybe it was the thought of them on,male
RED," Whatever it was, something lit a fire under that boy's ass.",male
RED, So Andy took Tommy under his wing. Started walking him through his ABCs...,male
RED," Tommy took to it pretty well, too. Boy found brains he never knew he had.",male
RED," After a while, you couldn't pry those books out of hands.",male
RED," Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements. He really liked the kid, that was part of it. Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap. But that wasn't the only reason...",male
RED, Prison time is slow time. Sometimes it feels like stop-time. So you do what you can to keep going,male
RED, Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it. It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks. The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall,male
RED," In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied.",male
RED, By 1966...right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...it was lovely Racquel.,male
RED," I have had some long nights in stir. Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade...",male
RED, That was the longest night of my life...,male
RED," They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job... ...he was willing to go.",male
RED, Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something.,male
RED, It was his third day on the job.,male
RED," And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean, it echoed.",male
RED, I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week stretch.,male
RED, Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole. Now I knew what he meant.,male
RED," In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison.",male
RED," All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub.",male
RED, I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Andy did it in less than twenty.,male
RED," Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, a million years of mountain-building there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia...",male
RED," Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure and time.",male
RED, That and a big damn poster.,male
RED," Like I said. In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied.",male
RED, It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time...,male
RED," While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years workin' the nightshift...",male
RED, Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through.,male
RED," I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough.",male
RED, Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.,male
RED," The guard simply didn't notice. Neither did I. I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes?",male
RED, Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to.,male
RED, Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile.,male
RED," The next morning, right about the time Racquel was spilling her little secret...",male
RED," ...a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco Bank of Portland. Until that moment, he didn't exist -- except on paper.",male
RED," He had all the proper I.D. Driver's license, birth certificate, social security card. The signature was a spot-on match.",male
RED," Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning. All told, he blew town with better than 370 thousand dollars of Warden Norton's money. Severance pay for nineteen years.",male
RED," I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away.",male
RED, Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly.,male
RED, I like to think the last thing that went through his head...other than that bullet...was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.,male
RED," Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark said, ""McNary, Texas.""",male
RED," McNary. Right on the border. That's where Andy crossed. When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it makes me laugh all over again...",male
RED," Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific.",male
RED," Those of us who knew him best talk about him often. I swear, the stuff he pulled. It always makes us laugh.",male
RED," Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are just too bright...",male
RED," ...and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice...but still, the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.",male
RED, I guess I just miss my friend.,male
RED, But there are times I curse him for the dreams he left behind...,male
RED, ...dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory.,male
RED, An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. It is a place that is blue beyond reason. Bluer than can possibly exist. Bluer than my mind can possibly grasp.,male
RED, I am terrified. There is no way home.,male
RED, Andy. I know you're in that place. Look at the stars for me just after sunset. Touch the sand...wade in the water...and feel free.,male
RED, Thirty years I've been asking permission to piss. I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.,male
RED," Women, too, that's the other thing. I forgot they were half the human race. There's women everywhere, every shape and size. I find myself semi-hard most of the time, cursing myself for a dirty old man.",male
RED," Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples poking out at the world. Jeezus, pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing.",male
RED," They're calling this the Summer of Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me.",male
RED, There is a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.,male
RED, All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole.,male
RED," Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.",male
RED, Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.,male
RED, Get busy living or get busy dying. That is goddamn right.,male
RED," For the second time in my life, I am guilty of committing a crime.",male
RED, Parole violation. I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that. Not for an old crook like me.,male
RED," I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain...",male
RED, I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.,male
HADLEY, On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again.,male
HADLEY, Eyes front.,male
HADLEY, YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- DICK MOTHERFUCKER!,male
HADLEY," Off with them clothes! And I didn't say take all day doing it, did I?",male
HADLEY, What the Christ is this happy shit?,male
HADLEY, You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass!,male
HADLEY, I ain't gonna count to three! Not even to one! Now shut the fuck up 'fore I sing you a lullabye!,male
HADLEY," ...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died.",male
HADLEY," I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get.",male
HADLEY, Thirty five thousand. That's what he left me.,male
HADLEY," Dumbshit. What do you figger the government's gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what.",male
HADLEY, Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride...,male
HADLEY," That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. Always get the short end. That's a fact. Some brother. Shit.",male
HADLEY, That's funny. You're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no fuckin' teeth.,male
HADLEY," That's it! Step aside, Mert. This fucker's havin' hisself an accident.",male
HADLEY, You better start making sense.,male
HADLEY," Naw, that ain't right! Tax free?",male
HADLEY, You're the smart banker what shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So's I can wind up in here with you?,male
HADLEY, Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart wife-killin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.,male
HADLEY," Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing cocksuckers!",male
HADLEY," What are you jimmies starin' at? Back to work, goddamn it!",male
HADLEY," Drink up, boys. While it's cold.",male
HADLEY, Poor fella must'a tripped.,male
HADLEY, You wanna explain this?,male
HADLEY," Looks pretty clean. Some contraband here, nothing to get in a twist over.",male
HADLEY, HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE! YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT SOMEBODY!,male
HADLEY," Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? Your ass, warden's office, now!",male
HADLEY," You tell me, fuck-stick! They're addressed to you, every damn one!",male
HADLEY," I want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, I shit you not.",male
HADLEY, who?,male
HADLEY, Last night's count.,male
HEYWOOD, Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life.,male
HEYWOOD, Bullshit. I'll take that action.,male
HEYWOOD," You're out some smokes, son. Take my word.",male
HEYWOOD, I say that chubby fat-ass...let's see...fifth from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck.,male
HEYWOOD, AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.',male
HEYWOOD," Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. You know why it's fine?",male
HEYWOOD," Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your horse comin' in last and all. Hell, I sure do love that horse of mine. I believe I owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when I see him.",male
HEYWOOD," Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this week? How's that winnin' horse of mine, anyway?",male
HEYWOOD, What? What'd you say?,male
HEYWOOD," What the fuck you care, new fish? Doesn't matter what his fuckin' name was. He's dead.",male
HEYWOOD, Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me!,male
HEYWOOD, Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' luck. Imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars.,male
HEYWOOD, Just keep spreadin' tar...,male
HEYWOOD," Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof...",male
HEYWOOD," Here's a cold one, Andy.",male
HEYWOOD, Sounds good to us. Figure we owe him for the beer.,male
HEYWOOD," What are you, fuckin' geologist?",male
HEYWOOD, What the hell is it then?,male
HEYWOOD, Bullshit.,male
HEYWOOD, My ass!,male
HEYWOOD," How you 'spect to do that, ""Mr. Dufresne-if-you-please?""",male
HEYWOOD, Sure. I know that. Sure.,male
HEYWOOD, Him? What about me? Crazy old fool! Goddamn near slit my throat!,male
HEYWOOD, Nothin'! Just came in to say fare- thee-well. Ain't you heard? His parole came through!,male
HEYWOOD," Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse, is what.",male
HEYWOOD," Institutionalized, my ass.",male
HEYWOOD, Shovel man in. Watch the dirt.,male
HEYWOOD," Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? Hank Williams?",male
HEYWOOD, Shit. No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week seems like a year.,male
HEYWOOD, Treasure Island. Robert Louis...,male
HEYWOOD, The Count of Monte Crisco...,male
HEYWOOD, ...by Alexandree Dumb-ass.,male
HEYWOOD," Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me.",male
HEYWOOD," Give us a break, lady.",male
HEYWOOD," No, ma'am.",male
HEYWOOD, You heard the lady.,male
HEYWOOD, You did a stretch in Cashman too?,male
HEYWOOD, Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I mean for real innocent? Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in here?,male
HEYWOOD, Oh Lord. Andy come down to the loading dock today. Asked me for a length of rope. Six foot long.,male
HEYWOOD, Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I?,male
HEYWOOD, How the hell was I s'pose to know?,male
HEYWOOD, Probably still up in the warden's.,male
HEYWOOD," Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all of us. Have a word with him. Ain't that right, Red?",male
FLOYD," Takin' bets today, Red?",male
FLOYD, Smokes. Put me down for two.,male
FLOYD," That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first.",male
FLOYD," You're so smart, you call it.",male
FLOYD, Smell my ass...,male
FLOYD, Gettin' himself killed.,male
FLOYD, That ain't quartz. Nor limestone.,male
FLOYD, He didn't say that!,male
FLOYD, Red? Andy? It's Brooks.,male
FLOYD," Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.",male
FLOYD, Was it worth two weeks in the hole?,male
FLOYD," Cristo, you dumbshit.",male
FLOYD, A month in the hole. Longest damn stretch I ever heard of.,male
FLOYD, Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen?,male
FLOYD, Where the hell is he?,male
FLOYD, Nothing we can do. Not tonight.,male
NORTON," This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?",male
NORTON," Any other questions? I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.",male
NORTON, ...the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.,male
NORTON, Solitary. A week. Make sure he takes his Bible.,male
NORTON, Add another week for blasphemy.,male
NORTON, I'm pleased to see you reading this. Any favorite passages?,male
NORTON," Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've always liked that one. But I prefer: ""I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.""",male
NORTON, I hear you're good with numbers. How nice. A man should have a skill.,male
NORTON, I can't say I approve of this... ...but I suppose exceptions can always be made.,male
NORTON, My wife made that in church group.,male
NORTON, You like working in the laundry?,male
NORTON, Perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education.,male
NORTON, Not a dime. My budget's stretched thin as it is.,male
NORTON," Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to prisons. More walls. More bars. More guards.",male
NORTON," They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy. I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that?",male
NORTON," ...a genuine, progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation. Our inmates, properly supervised, will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service. Cutting pulpwood, repairing bridges and causeways, digging storm drains...",male
NORTON," Ned, we're providing a valuable community service.",male
NORTON," Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over this contract. Seems to me I've already got my boys committed elsewhere. You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.",male
NORTON," Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again, they're gonna hear about it from me. How do I look?",male
NORTON, Big charity to-do up Portland way. Governor's gonna be there. Want the rest of that? Woman can't bake worth shit.,male
NORTON," Well. I have to say, that's the most amazing story I ever heard. What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.",male
NORTON," It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. He's young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didn't know what a state he'd put you in.",male
NORTON," Let's say for a moment Blatch does exist. You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, ""Yes, I did it! I confess! By all means, please add a life term to my sentence!""",male
NORTON, That's assuming Blatch is even still there. Chances are excellent he'd be released by now. Excellent.,male
NORTON, What? What did you call me?,male
NORTON," Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business. Don't make it mine. This meeting's over.",male
NORTON," Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office, not anywhere! Get in here! Now!",male
NORTON, Solitary! A month!,male
NORTON," Tommy, we've got a situation here. I think you can appreciate that.",male
NORTON," I tell you, son, this really came along and knocked my wind out. It's got me up nights, that's the truth.",male
NORTON, Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself?,male
NORTON, That's what I thought.,male
NORTON," Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape. Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it did.",male
NORTON, Nothing stops! NOTHING! Or you will do the hardest time there is. No more protection from the guards. I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and put you in with the biggest bull queer I can find. You'll think you got fucked by a train! And the library? Gone! Sealed off brick by brick! We'll have us a little book-barbecue in the yard! They'll see the flames for miles! We'll dance around it like wild Indians! Do you understand me? Are you catching my drift?,male
NORTON, Lickety-split. I wanna get home.,male
NORTON, Get my stuff down t'laundry. And shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' like mirrors.,male
NORTON, I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that friend of his!,male
NORTON, Him.,male
NORTON," What do you mean ""he just wasn't here?"" Don't say that to me, Haig! Don't say that to me again!",male
NORTON," I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?",male
NORTON, What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is!,male
NORTON," You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? ""Dufresne."" He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now!",male
NORTON," I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! He must'a said something!",male
NORTON," Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy- Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different?",male
NORTON, Lickety-split. I wanna get home.,male
HADLEY, First man into the shower!,male
HADLEY, Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in!,male
HADLEY, What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk?,male
HADLEY," Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary. If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, by God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all visit the infirmary. Every last motherfucker here.",male
HADLEY, That's him. That's the one.,male
HADLEY," What am I, talkin' to myself?",male
HEYWOOD," Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to me, boy. I know you're in there. I can hear you breathin'. Now don't you listen to these nitwits, hear?",male
HEYWOOD," This ain't such a bad place. I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home. I know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make your acquaintance...especially that big white mushy butt of yours...",male
BROOKS, You gonna eat that?,male
BROOKS, You mind?,male
BROOKS," Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel.",male
BROOKS, Andy! Thought I heard you out here!,male
BROOKS," I know, they told me. Ain't that a kick in the ass? Come on in, I'll give you the dime tour.",male
BROOKS," Here she is, the Shawshank Prison Library. Along this side, we got the National Geographics. That side, the Reader's Digest Condensed books. Bottom shelf there, some Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley Gardners. Every night I pile the cart and make my rounds. I write down the names on this clipboard here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?",male
BROOKS," Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years.",male
BROOKS," Never needed one. Not much to it, is there?",male
BROOKS, I dunno. Be nice to have some comp'ny down here for a change.,male
BROOKS, Pull down one'a them desks there.,male
BROOKS," God is my witness. And Dekins, he just blinks for a second, then laughs his ass off. Afterward, he actually shook Andy's hand.",male
BROOKS," Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about shit myself. All Andy needed was a suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on his desk, he would'a been Mister Dufresne, if you please.",male
BROOKS," Son, I've had six wardens through here during my tenure, and I have learned one great immutable truth of the universe: ain't one of 'em been born whose asshole don't pucker up tight as a snare drum when you ask for funds.",male
BROOKS, Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons of whores!,male
BROOKS, Nothing left to talk about! It's all talked out! Nothing left now but to cut his fuckin' throat!,male
BROOKS, That's what they want! It's the price I gotta pay!,male
BROOKS, But it's the only way they'll let me stay.,male
BROOKS, I can't take care of you no more. You go on now. You're free.,male
BROOKS," Yes sir, double-bag, surely will.",male
BROOKS, Mmm. Nice and ripe.,male
BROOKS, Jake says thanks. Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop. I'm lookin' after him till he's old enough to fly.,male
HEYWOOD," That's right, send 'em all down. I wanna see 'em lined up in a row, pretty as a chorus line.",male
HEYWOOD, C'mon! We're showin' our tools and grinnin' like fools! Take the damn picture!,male
RED, Quartz?,male
RED," Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs.",male
RED," Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on your pail!",male
RED, Andy! Come back! Shit!,male
RED, Feel bad about it if you want. But you didn't pull the trigger.,male
ANDY," There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill.",male
ANDY, How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there.,male
ANDY," That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him.",male
ANDY, To look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free.,male
NORTON, We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here...,male
NORTON," Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place just wasn't the same without you.",male
ANDY," What are you in for, Red?",male
ANDY, Can we talk business?,male
ANDY, Can we talk business?,male
ANDY," In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office.",male
ANDY, Anniversary gift. Open it.,male
ANDY, Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind. Wanted it to be a surprise.,male
ANDY," I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am.",male
ANDY, Three deposits tonight.,male
NORTON, Let's try the second tier.,male
NORTON, I almost forgot.,male
NORTON, I'd hate to deprive you of this. Salvation lies within.,male
NORTON, These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor while providing a valuable service to the community -- and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer!,male
NORTON," The right decision. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that is. You understand? Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna move on this, there can't be the least little shred of doubt. I have to know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth.",male
NORTON, Well?,male
NORTON, It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's what this is! (SMASH) It's one big damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And everyone's in on it! (SMASH) Including her!,male
HADLEY, Dufresne!,male
HADLEY," Go on, boy! We got a hold of you!",male
BROOKS, Dear Fellas. I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.,male
BROOKS, I saw an automobile once when I was young. Now they're everywhere.,male
BROOKS, The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.,male
BROOKS, People even talk faster. And louder.,male
BROOKS," The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway...",male
BROOKS," It's hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time.",male
BROOKS," Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.",male
BROOKS," I have trouble sleeping at night. The bed is too big. I have bad dreams, like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.",male
BROOKS," Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus.",male
BROOKS, But I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.,male
BROOKS, I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay.,male
BROOKS, I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me.,male
BROOKS, I don't think the store manager likes me very much.,male
RED," I like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it.",male
TOMMY, Well. Ain't this for shit?,male
TOMMY," C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like molasses! Makin' me look bad!",male
TOMMY," ...so I'm backin' out the door, right? Had the TV like this... Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. Suddenly, here's this voice: Freeze kid! Hands in the air! Well I just stand there holdin' on to that TV, so the voice says: ""You hear what I said, boy?"" And I say, Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop this fuckin' thing, you got me on destruction of property too!",male
TOMMY," Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me tell you. Work programs, weekend furloughs. Not like here.",male
TOMMY," What the hell you know about it, Capone? What are you in for?",male
TOMMY, I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for high school equivalency. Hear you helped some fellas with that.,male
TOMMY," Thing is, see... ...I don't read all that good.",male
TOMMY, So this raven just sits there and won't go away?,male
TOMMY, Why don't that fella get hisself a and dust the fucker?,male
TOMMY, The cat sh--The cat shh... The cat shat on the welcome mat?,male
TOMMY, Well. It's for shit. Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my time with this bullshit!,male
TOMMY, It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' thing right! Might as well be in Chinese!,male
TOMMY, I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out...,male
TOMMY, I feel bad. I let him down.,male
TOMMY," Smart fella, ain't he?",male
TOMMY, What's he in for anyway?,male
TOMMY, The hell you say.,male
TOMMY, Oh my God...,male
TOMMY," 'Bout four years ago, I was in Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch.",male
TOMMY, It's my fault.,male
TOMMY, The son of a bitch mailed it.,male
TOMMY, Thumb up my butt sounds better.,male
TOMMY, Out here?,male
TOMMY, Warden?,male
TOMMY," Yes sir, I sure can.",male
TOMMY, Yes sir. Absolutely.,male
TOMMY, Just gimme that chance.,male
TOMMY," Two points! Right there! There's your goddamn score! Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 times 5 is 25, fuck this place, fuck it!",male
TOMMY," C'mon, just throw it away. Will you please? Just throw it away?",male
TOMMY," Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. Few months left to go, I get a new cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of roomie you pray you don't get, know what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air. Talked all the time, too, that's the other thing. Never shut up. Places he'd been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. People that gave him shit, that's how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: ""Yeah? Who'd you kill?"" So he says...",male
ANDY," wife to marry me. We'd gone for a picnic. We made love under that tree. I asked and she said yes. Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something buried under it I want you to have.",male
NORTON, I don't care what it smells like!,male
NORTON," Never mind, I said! Just keep going!",male
RED," I look back on myself the way I was...stupid kid who did that terrible crime...wish I could talk sense to him. Tell him how things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, this old man is all that's left, and I have to live with that. Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit word, so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time. Truth is, I don't give a shit.",male
ANDY," Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out.",male
ANDY," And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy.",male
