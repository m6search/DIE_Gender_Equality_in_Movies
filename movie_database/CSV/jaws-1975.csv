BRODY, How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?,male
BRODY, Right.,male
BRODY, Probably out in the back yard.,male
BRODY," The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?",male
BRODY," Give me 30 years, I'll get it.",male
BRODY, Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!,male
BRODY, Feed the dogs.,male
BRODY, I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it.,male
BRODY, On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?,male
BRODY," Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?",male
BRODY," Sexy, hm? What was I before?",male
BRODY," I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -‚ sometimes you can weaken your eyes.",male
BRODY, Let's see...,male
BRODY," Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... Well, what do they usually do, float or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll meet both of you at the beach in ...20 minutes, okay? Okay. First goddamn weekend of the summer.",male
BRODY, The office.,male
BRODY, Here? You gotta be kiddin'.,male
BRODY, Christine what?,male
BRODY, You picked her up on the ferry.,male
BRODY, And nobody else saw her in the water?,male
BRODY, Think she might've run out on you?,male
BRODY, You from around here?,male
BRODY, You here for the summer?,male
BRODY, What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?,male
BRODY, Pretty stiff.,male
BRODY," If this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there. The 'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?",male
BRODY," Jesus, Santos.",male
BRODY," leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks her head and removes the phone from his ear.",male
BRODY," Polly, I want to know what water recreation is on for today.",male
BRODY, Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?,male
BRODY," Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?",male
BRODY," Get out of there ‚ take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.",male
BRODY, Do I need any more authority?,male
BRODY, Now tell me something I don't know.,male
BRODY, So we should set out a smorgasbord?,male
BRODY, What else could've done that?,male
BRODY," Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!",male
BRODY, I was only reacting to what I was told.,male
BRODY, I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.,male
BRODY, What?,male
BRODY, How's the water?,male
BRODY, Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water...,male
BRODY, Michael! Sean! Out of the water. Everybody out of the water! Michael! Get out!,male
BRODY," Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.",male
BRODY, I'm responsible for public safety around here...,male
BRODY, I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...,male
BRODY," I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.",male
BRODY, Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time.,male
BRODY, I didn't agree to that!,male
BRODY," his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's mood.",male
BRODY, Love a cup of tea. With lemon.,male
BRODY, Where is he?,male
BRODY, Son! -- Out of the water now!,male
BRODY, I want him out of the ocean.,male
BRODY, Michael! Come inside!,male
BRODY," I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...",male
BRODY, That wasn't funny.,male
BRODY, Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.,male
BRODY, Hey! You know how many men that's supposed to hold?,male
BRODY, What you got ain't safe. You take some guys off or you don't go out.,male
BRODY," You going out too, Ben?",male
BRODY," Just back up! No, the other way! Cut it to your left! Your other left! The big boat, your front end is out way too far. Little boat, stay still!",male
BRODY, Thanks.,male
BRODY," If that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port.",male
BRODY, Hand it over.,male
BRODY," You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.",male
BRODY, Who are you?,male
BRODY, Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.,male
BRODY," No, it was local jurisdiction.",male
BRODY," No, we just checked the beach...",male
BRODY, You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?,male
BRODY," Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!",male
BRODY, Sure he is.,male
BRODY," Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.",male
BRODY, What d'ya mean?,male
BRODY," Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.",male
BRODY, She's right.,male
BRODY, I'm going home.,male
BRODY, C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.,male
BRODY, Because he needs it.,male
BRODY, Swell.,male
BRODY, How come you have to tell them that?,male
BRODY, Let's all have a drink.,male
BRODY," Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?",male
BRODY, Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?,male
BRODY," There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...",male
BRODY, Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?,male
BRODY," And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?",male
BRODY," Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.",male
BRODY, I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come?,male
BRODY, What stinks so bad?,male
BRODY, What's that?,male
BRODY, What? What?!,male
BRODY, How can you tell?,male
BRODY, He ate a car?,male
BRODY, What do we do?,male
BRODY, Chum?,male
BRODY, What is all this stuff?,male
BRODY, Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?,male
BRODY, Where'd you get all this?,male
BRODY, You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?,male
BRODY, We gotta get back soon...,male
BRODY, Hey!,male
BRODY, That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the Flicka! Ben? Ben!,male
BRODY, What happened?,male
BRODY, Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?,male
BRODY, Why don't we just tow it in?,male
BRODY," Be careful, for chrissake.",male
BRODY, You all right?,male
BRODY, No shark did that to a boat!,male
BRODY, There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.,male
BRODY," There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.",male
BRODY," A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!",male
BRODY," We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.",male
BRODY, He lost it on the way up.,male
BRODY," We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.",male
BRODY, That means closing the beaches.,male
BRODY, Wait a minute! I need you.,male
BRODY," Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.",male
BRODY, What is this?,male
BRODY, I signed on the wrong line...,male
BRODY," I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and I hope we won't actually be needing your services. But I'm glad to have you here.",male
BRODY," We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay?",male
BRODY, I wish it would rain...,male
BRODY," I'm sorry, I just don't have the time.",male
BRODY, Hey Mikey -- !,male
BRODY, Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.,male
BRODY, Just a favor for your old man.,male
BRODY," Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please --",male
BRODY, No whistles! No whistles!,male
BRODY, He's in shock. Get blankets!,male
BRODY, Here -- Take him home.,male
BRODY, No. Home here.,male
BRODY, There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.,male
BRODY, I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.,male
BRODY, Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?,male
BRODY, The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs.,male
BRODY," Just sign it, Larry.",male
BRODY, This has got to be one big violation...,male
BRODY, What?,male
BRODY, I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price.,male
BRODY, You got it.,male
BRODY, You got it.,male
BRODY, You got it.,male
BRODY, Two cases. And dinner when you land.,male
BRODY, This is Matt Hooper...,male
BRODY, He's from the Oceanographic Institute.,male
BRODY, Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...,male
BRODY, It's my charter. My party.,male
BRODY, You got it.,male
BRODY," Colorful, isn't he?",male
BRODY, Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.,male
BRODY, Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.,male
BRODY, Tell 'em I went fishin'!,male
BRODY, Who's driving the boat?,male
BRODY," Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?",male
BRODY, You got it?,male
BRODY, The wire's showing!,male
BRODY, What's the point with hooks and Lines? --,male
BRODY, How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?,male
BRODY, What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?,male
BRODY, Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.,male
BRODY, Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...,male
BRODY, C'mon. Middle appendix --,male
BRODY," What's that one, there?",male
BRODY," What's that, a ship?",male
BRODY, What the hell?,male
BRODY, Where...?,male
BRODY, The barrel!,male
BRODY, Shark! Starboard!,male
BRODY, That's it! Radio in for help!,male
BRODY," Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.",male
BRODY," Some great idea! Now where are we? Some goddamn skipper you are. You're certifiable, y'know that? You're a real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!",male
BRODY, Did you get him in the head?,male
BRODY, I can't stand here doing nothing!,male
BRODY, What about us?,male
BRODY, Where'd he go?,male
BRODY, Have you ever had one do this?,male
BRODY," There! The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping sounds.",male
BRODY, He's trying to sink us!,male
BRODY, He's chasing us! I,male
BRODY, You gotta go in the water...,male
BRODY, He's taken him!,male
BRODY, No... You think we can get back with those?,male
BRODY, What day is this?,male
BRODY, Think the tide's with us?,male
BRODY," Y'know, I used to hate the water...",male
ELLEN, 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.,female
ELLEN, Do you see the kids?,female
ELLEN," In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'",female
ELLEN, Like you're from N'Yawk.,female
ELLEN, You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.,female
ELLEN, Don't be silly -‚ You're going to make summer better for them...,female
ELLEN, Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid.,female
ELLEN, I think they make you look sexy.,female
ELLEN," Older, sillier.",female
ELLEN, There. What was that?,female
ELLEN, Be careful.,female
ELLEN, Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.,female
ELLEN, What about this kid? What if he were born here. That make him an islander?,female
ELLEN," Do you want the boys to come in? Honey, if you're worried...",female
ELLEN," You're very tight, y'know? Right there.",female
ELLEN, What is it...?,female
ELLEN, Can you stand something to eat?,female
ELLEN, Mikey loves his birthday present.,female
ELLEN, He's sitting in it.,female
ELLEN," It's three feet deep, Martin",female
ELLEN," It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.",female
ELLEN, You heard your father! Out right now!,female
ELLEN, So would I. Come on in.,female
ELLEN, My husband tells me you're in sharks.,female
ELLEN, You love sharks?,female
ELLEN," Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.",female
ELLEN, Thank you.,female
ELLEN, You're leaving?,female
ELLEN, Is that a boat?,female
ELLEN," Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.",female
ELLEN," I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?",female
ELLEN," Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.",female
ELLEN, Can you do that?,female
ELLEN," Hey, big guy -- you want anything from home?",female
ELLEN, Home... New York?,female
ELLEN, Did you take your dramamine? Here.,female
ELLEN, Is that him?,female
ELLEN, You going to be all right?,female
ELLEN," I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.",female
ELLEN, What'll I tell the kids?,female
ELLEN, I never hear the whistle.,female
ELLEN, Don't forget these.,female
ELLEN, Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty with a double-knot.,female
ELLEN, Would you like something? Some coffee?,female
BRODY, Love ya.,male
BRODY, Maybe that's your girl.,male
BRODY," You too, sweetheart...",male
BRODY, What the hell?,male
BRODY," You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?",male
BRODY, Got a pen on you?,male
BRODY, How're we gonna handle this?,male
HENDRICKS, We never had any. What's the problem?,male
HENDRICKS," Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.",male
HENDRICKS, What's the matter with my printing?,male
HENDRICKS," We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.",male
HENDRICKS," I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.",male
HENDRICKS, I've got all these signs here...,male
HENDRICKS," ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.",male
HENDRICKS, Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.,male
HENDRICKS, Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.,male
HENDRICKS, False alarm. Must be this glare.,male
HENDRICKS, Where -- ?,male
VAUGHN," What have you got there, Lenny?",male
VAUGHN," Who've you told this to, Lenny?",male
VAUGHN," Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny.",male
VAUGHN," C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.",male
VAUGHN, Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?,male
VAUGHN, That's just going by the book. We're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. This is your first summer.,male
VAUGHN," All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.",male
VAUGHN, Boat propeller?,male
VAUGHN," Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along --",male
VAUGHN, I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.,male
VAUGHN," It's all psychological, anyway. You yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'.",male
VAUGHN," Martin, we hired the best man we could find.",male
VAUGHN, Now then. We've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about...,male
VAUGHN," Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt. Everybody, could I have your attention? Since this affects all of us, I suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room...",male
VAUGHN," Well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions?",male
VAUGHN, That's private business between you brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. -- Chief --,male
VAUGHN," No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.",male
VAUGHN, Only 24 hours!,male
VAUGHN," Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the Selectmen will take your offer under advisement",male
VAUGHN, That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.,male
VAUGHN, Who's that young man?,male
VAUGHN, I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.,male
VAUGHN," That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!",male
VAUGHN," Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need?",male
VAUGHN," I am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock. Besides... We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.",male
VAUGHN," I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.",male
VAUGHN," Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.",male
VAUGHN, Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?,male
VAUGHN, What kind of a shark did you say it was?,male
VAUGHN," Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.",male
VAUGHN, I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...,male
VAUGHN," Come here, I want to show you something.",male
VAUGHN, You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.,male
VAUGHN," August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.",male
VAUGHN," How about them indeed. I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here. As you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time. Amity, y'know, means 'Friendship.'",male
VAUGHN, Why don't you get in the water?,male
VAUGHN, Nobody's going in!,male
VAUGHN, Why?,male
VAUGHN, I don't know if I can do that without a...,male
VAUGHN, Maybe we can save August...,male
VAUGHN, I was acting in the town's best interests...,male
VAUGHN, My kids were on that beach...,male
MEADOWS," Technically, you need the instruction of a civic ordinance, or a special meeting of the town selectmen...",male
MEADOWS, We're not even sure what it was.,male
MEADOWS," Remember when Fred Ganz went scalloping in his BVD's? He was going to swim to New Bedford, he said.",male
MEADOWS, We never had that kind of trouble here.,male
MEADOWS, You have our complete support.,male
MEADOWS," I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out- of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.",male
MEADOWS," What's going on with the beaches, Chief?",male
MEADOWS," Ginny, get this out on the state wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New York. Have one of them pick it up for the national and call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him this is from me and he owes me one... let's get a picture.",male
MEADOWS," Okay, everybody, I want to get a picture for the paper -- could everyone clear out of the way?",male
MEADOWS, Plenty.,male
MEADOWS," Beautiful day, Chief!",male
MEADOWS, ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?,male
MEADOWS," Could you get out of the shot, young man?",male
VAUGHN, You yell 'Shark' and we've got a panic on our hands. I think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of July.,male
VAUGHN," We need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things.",male
VAUGHN," Chief, I'll take responsibility for this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl take him out and dump him right in the drink.",male
VAUGHN," Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!",male
QUINT," Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, Okay? I ordered them.",male
QUINT, They choke on it.,male
QUINT," You all know me. You know what I do for a living. I'll go out and get this bird for you. He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow a man whole. A little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go. You gotta get this fellow and get him quick. If you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis.",male
QUINT, Did you bring a check?,male
QUINT, Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?,male
QUINT," And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.",male
QUINT," And incidental damages, if any...",male
QUINT, And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.,male
QUINT," And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.",male
QUINT, Try some of this. I made it myself.,male
QUINT," You want to get paid, you go.",male
QUINT," This is the last time I hear from you. I don't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel. Put that blackfish on board, pump the bilges, and top off the fuel tanks, and finish up in the morning. Then you're on the beach.",male
QUINT, I know who he is...,male
QUINT, Transplants?,male
QUINT, I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.,male
QUINT, Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank.,male
QUINT, Let me see your hands...,male
QUINT, What do you mean 'We...?',male
QUINT," All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast.",male
QUINT," lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips, pliers, irons...",male
QUINT," Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.",male
QUINT," Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?",male
QUINT," Who's inside, you or the shark?",male
QUINT," Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.",male
QUINT, Cast off the bow line! Now your stern!,male
QUINT," Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right... I'll throw your ass through that little round window.",male
QUINT, Here's something for you...,male
QUINT, These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts.,male
QUINT," Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em where you got it!",male
QUINT, Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...,male
QUINT, Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.,male
QUINT, Nobody. We're drifting with the current.,male
QUINT," Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...",male
QUINT," Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me.",male
QUINT, It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.,male
QUINT, ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.,male
QUINT," Now if he weren't around, we'd of hooked something else by now, wouldn't we? But he scared 'em all away. Big lonesome son of a bitch...",male
QUINT, -- he'll gulp it down now... Hooooooo!,male
QUINT," Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick!",male
QUINT, Neutral! Where the hell is he going?,male
QUINT," Down here, Hooper!",male
QUINT," Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!",male
QUINT," Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --",male
QUINT, Watch your hands -- Grab onto this!,male
QUINT, Fasten the pole.,male
QUINT," Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.",male
QUINT," What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?",male
QUINT, Over there!,male
QUINT, At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.,male
QUINT, feet. And three tons of him there.,male
QUINT, Orca here.,male
QUINT, Put her on.,male
QUINT," This is Quint, Missus.",male
QUINT, He's busy.,male
QUINT," Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.",male
QUINT, Here. Rig this to the forward keg up there.,male
QUINT, Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady now...,male
QUINT," Get clear, damn you!",male
QUINT, Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!,male
QUINT," Now you've done it, you piss-ant. Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to my gear. Let the bastard fight the keg for a while. He can't stay down with that on.",male
QUINT, We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.,male
QUINT," You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...",male
QUINT, He's up again.,male
QUINT, Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.,male
QUINT, Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.,male
QUINT, Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --,male
QUINT, And I'll drink to yours.,male
QUINT, And here's to the ladies. And here's to their sisters; I'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters.,male

QUINT, Tattoo. Had it taken off.,male
QUINT, 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.,male
QUINT," Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis. June 29th, 1945, three and a half minutes past midnight, two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side. Two or three. We was still under sealed orders after deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima bomb...we was goin' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn near eleven hundred men went over the side. The life boats was lashed down so tight to make the bomb run we couldn't cut a single one adrift. Not one. And there was no rafts. None. That vessel sank in twelve minutes. Yes, that's all she took.",male
QUINT," Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I had a little drink about an hour ago, and it went right to my head. Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse becomes a warm cozy place.",male

QUINT," A shark of that size is no pleasure and I value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks. I'll find him for three. But I'll kill him for ten.",male
QUINT," Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?",male
QUINT," We didn't see the first shark till we'd been in the water about an hour. A thirteen-footer near enough. A blue. You measure that by judgin' the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... of course the Captain knew...I guess some officers knew... was the bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signals was sent. What the men didn't know was that they wouldn't even list us as overdue for a week. Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't an officer -- just as well perhaps. So some of us were dead already -- in the water -- just hangin' limp in our lifejackets. And several already bleedin'. And the three hundred or so laying on the bottom of the ocean. As the light went, the sharks came crusin'. We formed tight groups -- somewhat like squares in an old battle -- You know what I mean -- so that when one come close, the man nearest would yell and shout and pound the water and sometimes it worked and the fish turned away, but other times that shark would seem to look right at a man -- right into his eyes -- and in spite of all shoutin' and poundin' you'd hear that terrible high screamin' and the ocean would go red, then churn up as they ripped him.  Then we'd reform our little squares. By the first dawn the sharks had taken more than a hundred. Hard for me to count but more than a hundred. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe a thousand. I do know they averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. In the middle of the second day, some of us started to go crazy from the thirst.",male
QUINT," One fella cried out he saw a river, another claimed he saw a waterfall, some started to drink the ocean and choked on it, and some left our little groups -- our little squares -- and swam off alone lookin' for islands and the sharks always took them right away. It was mainly the young fellas that did that -- the older ones stayed where they was. That second day -- my life jacket rubbed me raw and that was more blood in the water. Oh my. On Thursday morning I bumped up against a friend of mine -- Herbie Robinson from Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it seemed he was asleep but when I reached over to waken him, he bobbed in the water and I saw his body upend because he'd been bitten in half beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it went on -- bombers high overhead but nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, sharks, and all this goin' crazy and dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung around and came in low. Yes. He did that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And early evenin', a big fat PBY come down out of the sky and began the pickup.  That was when I was most frightened of all -- while I was waitin' for my turn. Just two and a half hours short of five days and five nights when they got to me and took me up. Eleven hundred of us went into that ocean -- three hundred and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen hundred and forty five. June the",male
QUINT, The bastard is costing you more'n that every day. Do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter. I'm gonna kill this thing... just a matter of whether I do it now -- or at the end of summer.,male
QUINT, Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged women.,male
QUINT," Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.",male

QUINT, Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on!,male
QUINT, Let's see who's gonna tease who now!,male
QUINT," A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.",male
QUINT, I never saw one that big.,male
QUINT," Get up there and steer her. Follow my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've got to get a clean shot at that porker's head.",male
QUINT," Hurry up, rig the line!",male
QUINT," The line, man, the line!",male
QUINT," That's not so bad. Look at this: ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, in Boston, where some sunovabitch winged me upside the head with a spittoon.",male

HOOPER," Excuse me, I wonder if you could tell me...",male
HOOPER, There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.,male

HOOPER," Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.",male
HOOPER," Victim One, identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian...",male
HOOPER," Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non- frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?",male
HOOPER," It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.",male

HOOPER," There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.",male
HOOPER, Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...,male
HOOPER, Wait a minute...,male
HOOPER," Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...",male
HOOPER, Is anyone having this...?,male
HOOPER," Here... one red, one white.",male
HOOPER, I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.,male
HOOPER," I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.",male
HOOPER," They caught a shark, not the shark. Big difference. I could've proved it this afternoon, by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents. Also, his bite was too small.",male
HOOPER," Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.",male
HOOPER, Going out on the 'Aurora.',male

HOOPER, Yep.,male
HOOPER, Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...,male
HOOPER, About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.,male

HOOPER," If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.",male
HOOPER," Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...",male

HOOPER, Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd believe it!,male
HOOPER," You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.",male
HOOPER, A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!,male
