770,BOROMIR, Isildur’s Bane.,1,male
771,BOROMIR," It is a gift ... a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay ... by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy ... let us use it against him!",1,male
772,BOROMIR, And what would a Ranger know of this matter?,1,male
773,BOROMIR, Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?,1,male
774,BOROMIR, Gondor has no king.,1,male
775,BOROMIR," One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland riddled with fire, and ash and dust ... the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand Men could you do this. It is folly.",1,male
776,BOROMIR," And what if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?",1,male
777,BOROMIR," You carry the fates of us all, little one.",1,male
778,BOROMIR," Get away from the blade, Pippin ... on your toes ... good, very good ... I want you to react, not think.",1,male
779,BOROMIR, Move your feet.,1,male
780,BOROMIR, It's moving fast ... against the wind.,1,male
781,BOROMIR, Merry ... Pippin ... Sam ... take cover!,1,male
782,BOROMIR, It is a strange fate that we should,1,male
783,BOROMIR, As you wish. I care not.,1,male
784,BOROMIR, We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city!,1,male
785,BOROMIR, This is no mine ... It's a tomb!,1,male
786,BOROMIR, We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.,1,male
787,BOROMIR, Legolas!,1,male
788,BOROMIR, They have a cave-troll!,1,male
789,BOROMIR, What is this new devilry?,1,male

791,BOROMIR, Give them a moment ... for pity's sake!,1,male

793,BOROMIR," I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me, “Even now, there is hope left.” But I cannot see it ... it is long since we had any  hope.",1,male
794,BOROMIR," One day, our paths will lead us there, and the tower guard will take up the call “the Lords of Gondor have returned.”",1,male
795,BOROMIR," And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts, it will make the crossing even more dangerous.",1,male
796,BOROMIR, Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.,1,male
797,BOROMIR, You were quick enough to trust the Elves.,1,male
798,BOROMIR, None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you ... Frodo?,1,male
799,BOROMIR," I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?",1,male
800,BOROMIR," Let me help you. There are other ways, Frodo ... other paths that we might take.",1,male
801,BOROMIR, Warning? Against what?,1,male
802,BOROMIR, I ask only for the strength to defend my people. If you would but lend me the Ring...,1,male
803,BOROMIR, Why do you recoil? I am no thief.,1,male
804,BOROMIR," What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the Ring and you will beg for death before the end.",1,male
805,BOROMIR, I see your mind ... you will take the Ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all your Halflings!,1,male
806,BOROMIR, Run! Run!,1,male
807,BOROMIR, They took the little ones...,1,male
808,BOROMIR, Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him.,1,male
809,BOROMIR, Forgive me. I did not see ... I have failed you all.,1,male
810,BOROMIR, Leave it! It is over ... the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin ... Aragorn...,1,male
811,BOROMIR, Our people ... our people...,1,male
812,BOROMIR, The shards of Narsil ... the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.,1,male
813,BOROMIR, Still sharp.,1,male
814,BOROMIR, But no more than a broken heirloom.,1,male
815,BOROMIR," If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done.",1,male
816,BOROMIR," My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing, and our ... our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right ... and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze ... have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?",1,male
817,BOROMIR," Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men. But you will not see that.",1,male
818,BOROMIR, You are afraid!,1,male
819,BOROMIR," Scared of who you are, of what you are.",1,male
820,BOROMIR," We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have ... don't you see that is madness?",1,male
821,BOROMIR," You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance. It might have been mine! It should be mine! Give it to me! Give me the Ring.",1,male
822,BOROMIR," Frodo! Frodo! What have I done? Please, Frodo...",1,male
823,BOROMIR, Frodo ... where is Frodo?,1,male
824,BOROMIR," I would have followed you, my brother ... my captain, my king.",1,male
990,BOROMIR," All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.",1,male
991,BOROMIR," I’m sorry, Frodo ... Frodo...",1,male
685,BUTTERBUR," Good evening, little masters. If you're seeking accommodation, we’ve got some nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available. Mr...ah...",1,male
686,BUTTERBUR, Underhill? Hmmmm.,1,male
687,BUTTERBUR," Gandalf ... Gandalf ... Oh... Oh, yes! I remember ... elderly chap ... big grey beard ... pointy hat?",1,male
688,BUTTERBUR," He's one of them Rangers; they’re dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I never heard, but round here he's known as Strider.",1,male
689,BUTTERBUR, Not seen him for six months.,1,male
953,CELEBORN," The enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone. Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. I can no longer see him from afar.",1,male
954,CELEBORN," What now becomes of this Fellowship? Without Gandalf, hope is lost.",1,male
955,CELEBORN," Strange creatures bearing the White under the sun, yet these have done so.",1,male
956,CELEBORN, Le aphadar aen. You are being tracked.,1,male
957,CELEBORN, By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.,1,male
985,CELEBORN, Never before have we clad strangers,1,male
986,CELEBORN," Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank.",1,male
987,CELEBORN, May these cloaks help shield you from,1,male
630,DADDY TWOFOOT," There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves, and others of a less than savoury nature.",1,male

31,ELROND," Lasto beth nîn. Tolo dan na ngalad. Hear my voice, come back to the light",1,male
32,ELROND," Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.",1,male
33,ELROND, His strength returns.,1,male
34,ELROND, Yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring ... the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.,1,male
35,ELROND," Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His Eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.",1,male
36,ELROND, This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves... We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard ... Gandalf ... the Ring,1,male
37,ELROND," Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is failing. The blood of Númenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives.",1,male
38,ELROND, Isildur ... hurry ... follow me!,1,male
39,ELROND, Cast it in the fire ... destroy it!,1,male
40,ELROND, Isildur!!,1,male
41,ELROND," It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring ... and the line of kings was broken. There’s no strength left in the world of Men. They are scattered, divided, leaderless.",1,male
42,ELROND, He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile.,1,male
43,ELROND, Strangers from distant lands ... friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.  You will unite ... or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate ... this one doom...,1,male
44,ELROND, Boromir!,1,male
45,ELROND, Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.,1,male
46,ELROND, You have only one choice ... the Ring,1,male
47,ELROND," The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin, by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom ... only there can it be unmade.",1,male
48,ELROND," No, indeed ... it is hardly possible to separate you ... even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.",1,male
49,ELROND, Nine companions ... so be it. You shall be the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.,1,male
50,ELROND," In her heart, your mother knew you’d be hunted all your life. That you’d never escape your fate. The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings, but only you have the power to wield it.",1,male
51,ELROND, You are the last of that bloodline.,1,male
52,ELROND," The time has come for the Ring to set out. You cannot count on your journey being aided by war or force. You will pass into the domain of the Enemy far word Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?",1,male
53,ELROND," Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel. I can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to Mountains, and draws nigh even to the borders of  the Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; but so perilous have the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or come no quicker than you yourself. Had I a host of Elves in armor of the Elder Days, it would avail little, save to arouse the power of Mordor. Are you confident in your companions?",1,male
54,ELROND," And what of your Hobbit friends? I had hoped to send them back to the Shire as messengers to warn the people of the impending danger according to the fashion of your country. I feel that the youngest, Peregrin Took, should not go with you. My heart is against it.",1,male
55,ELROND, Let it be so then. The Fellowship awaits.,1,male
56,ELROND," The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On you who travel with him, no oath nor bond is laid to go further that you will. Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you.",1,male
757,ELROND," You have found your way to the last homely house east of the sea. The Elves of Imladris have dwelt within this valley for 3,000 years though few of my kin now remain.",1,male
758,ELROND," Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all together and in the darkness bind them, In the Land of Mordor where the",1,male
759,ELROND, This peril belongs to all Middle-Earth. They must decide now how to end it.,1,male
760,ELROND, The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we’ve gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.,1,male
761,ELROND," I was there, Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago when Isildur took the Ring.",1,male
762,ELROND, I was there when the day the strength of Men failed.,1,male
763,ELROND," I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged: the one place it could be destroyed.",1,male
826,ELROND," Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.",1,male

188,FRODO, We wish to stay at the inn ... our business is our own.,1,male
189,FRODO, Excuse me.,1,male
190,FRODO, Underhill ... my name's Underhill.,1,male
191,FRODO, We're friends of Gandalf the Grey... Can you tell him we've arrived?,1,male
192,FRODO," Sam, he'll be here. He’ll come.",1,male
193,FRODO," Excuse me, that Man in the corner, who is he?",1,male
194,FRODO, Strider.,1,male
195,FRODO, Pippin!,1,male
196,FRODO, What do you want?,1,male
197,FRODO, I carry nothing.,1,male
198,FRODO, Who are you?,1,male
199,FRODO, Yes.,1,male
200,FRODO, What are they?,1,male
201,FRODO, Where are you taking us?,1,male
202,FRODO, I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.,1,male
203,FRODO, We have no choice but to trust him.,1,male
204,FRODO, Who is she? This woman you sing of?,1,male
205,FRODO, What happened to her?,1,male
206,FRODO, What are you doing?,1,male
207,FRODO," Put it out, you fools! put it out!",1,male
208,FRODO, Go!,1,male
209,FRODO, Gandalf ... Gandalf?,1,male
210,FRODO, Where am I?,1,male
211,FRODO, Gandalf!,1,male
212,FRODO," What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you meet us?",1,male
213,FRODO, Gandalf! What is it?,1,male
214,FRODO, Bilbo!,1,male
215,FRODO, Bilbo!,1,male
216,FRODO," I miss the Shire ... I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else ... off with you, on one of your adventures... But my own adventure turned out to be quite different ... I'm not like you, Bilbo.",1,male
217,FRODO, Packed already?,1,male
218,FRODO," I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam?",1,male
219,FRODO, More than anything.,1,male
220,FRODO," You're right, Sam...",1,male
221,FRODO, I will take it ... I will take it ... I will take the Ring to Mordor.,1,male
222,FRODO, It's so light!,1,male
223,FRODO, I do. I must. I will go with Sam.,1,male
224,FRODO," Yes, Lord Elrond. I must be, I’m afraid, for if I doubt them, we may never succeed.",1,male
225,FRODO," His heart is set upon going. There will be no stopping him, even if you did send him home in a sack.",1,male
226,FRODO," Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?",1,male
227,FRODO, We will go through the mines.,1,male
228,FRODO, Better than it was.,1,male
229,FRODO, Who then do I trust?,1,male
230,FRODO, What do you mean?,1,male
231,FRODO, It's a riddle...,1,male
232,FRODO," Speak, friend, and enter. What's the Elvish word for friend?",1,male
233,FRODO, There's something down there.,1,male
234,FRODO, Gollum!,1,male
235,FRODO, He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dûr?,1,male
236,FRODO, It’s a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.,1,male
237,FRODO, I wish the Ring had never come to me ... I wish none of this had happened.,1,male
238,FRODO, Aragorn! Aragorn!,1,male
239,FRODO, I'm all right. I'm not hurt.,1,male
240,FRODO, Gandalf!,1,male
241,FRODO, Gandalf!,1,male
242,FRODO, No!,1,male
243,FRODO, What is it?,1,male
244,FRODO, Do you believe we may yet succeed in our quest?,1,male
245,FRODO, What will I see?,1,male
246,FRODO, Gandalf!,1,male
247,FRODO, I cannot do this alone.,1,male
248,FRODO, Then I know what I must do. It's just I’m afraid to do it.,1,male
249,FRODO," No, Sam.",1,male
250,FRODO, I’m all right.,1,male
251,FRODO," You can’t help me, Sam. Not this time. Get some sleep.",1,male
252,FRODO," I know what you would say, and it would sound like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.",1,male
253,FRODO, There is no other way.,1,male
254,FRODO, No...,1,male
255,FRODO, You are not yourself.,1,male
256,FRODO, It has taken Boromir.,1,male
257,FRODO, Stay away!,1,male
258,FRODO, Can you protect me from yourself?,1,male
259,FRODO," I know. Look after the others, especially Sam ... he will not understand.",1,male
260,FRODO," No, Sam.",1,male
261,FRODO," Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone.",1,male
262,FRODO, You can't swim.,1,male
263,FRODO," Oh, Sam!",1,male
264,FRODO, Mordor! I hope the others find a safer road.,1,male
265,FRODO, I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.,1,male
266,FRODO, Sam?,1,male
435,FRODO, He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I’m not looking.,1,male
436,FRODO," If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.",1,male
437,FRODO, I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened...,1,male
611,FRODO, Bilbo! Bilbo!,1,male
612,FRODO, He talked for so long about leaving ... I didn’t think he’d really do it.,1,male
613,FRODO, ...there are markings.,1,male
614,FRODO, It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.,1,male
615,FRODO," Do they, Gandalf?",1,male
616,FRODO, Get off the road!,1,male
617,FRODO, “There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale” by Bilbo Baggins.,1,male
618,FRODO, This is wonderful.,1,male
619,FRODO, ...we did what we set out to do.,1,male
620,FRODO, The Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home.,1,male
621,FRODO, Though I do not know the way.,1,male
622,FRODO, Would you destroy it?,1,male
623,FRODO, Sam!,1,male
624,FRODO, Come on then...,1,male
625,FRODO, I'm glad you're with me.,1,male
633,GAFFER," Far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is. You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.",1,male
634,GAFFER," Well, it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you.",1,male
0,GALADRIEL," “I amar presten aen: han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae ... a han noston ned wilith.” The world is changed: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air ... Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.",1,female
1,GALADRIEL, It began with the forging of the Great Rings.,1,female
2,GALADRIEL, And some things that should not have been forgotten ... were lost.,1,female
3,GALADRIEL, Thus a Third Age of Middle-Earth began. History became legend ... legend became myth.,1,female
4,GALADRIEL, Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the East ... whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived ... its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum.,1,female
5,GALADRIEL, Frodo...,1,female
6,GALADRIEL," ...your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.",1,female
7,GALADRIEL," My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.",1,female
8,GALADRIEL," Farewell, Frodo Baggins.",1,female
9,GALADRIEL," Three were given to the Elves: immortal, wisest ... fairest of all beings.",1,female
10,GALADRIEL, Seven to the Dwarf Lords: great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.,1,female
11,GALADRIEL," And Nine ... nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power.",1,female
12,GALADRIEL," But they were all of them deceived. ...for another Ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others. ...and into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all... One by one the Free lands of Middle earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some ... who resisted. A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor. On the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth.",1,female
13,GALADRIEL, Victory was near!,1,female
14,GALADRIEL," But the power of the Ring could not be undone. It was in this moment ... when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated.",1,female
15,GALADRIEL, The Ring passed to Isildur ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur to his death.,1,female
16,GALADRIEL," And for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge.",1,female
17,GALADRIEL," Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer.",1,female
18,GALADRIEL, And there it consumed him.,1,female
19,GALADRIEL, The Ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave...,1,female
20,GALADRIEL, It waited.,1,female
21,GALADRIEL, But something happened then the Ring did not intend...,1,female
22,GALADRIEL, It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable... What’s this? A Hobbit ... Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.,1,female
23,GALADRIEL, ...one who has seen the eye.,1,female
24,GALADRIEL, These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war.,1,female
25,GALADRIEL," Do not fear, young Peregrin Took. You will find your courage.",1,female
26,GALADRIEL," And for you, Samwise Gamgee, Elven rope made of hithlain.",1,female
27,GALADRIEL," May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.",1,female
958,GALADRIEL, Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into Shadow.,1,female
959,GALADRIEL, Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his full purpose.,1,female
960,GALADRIEL," Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dûm fill your heart Gimli, son of Glóin. For the world has grown full of peril, and in all lands, love is now mingled with grief.",1,female
961,GALADRIEL," The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all... Yet hope remains while the company is true.",1,female
962,GALADRIEL," Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest, for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.",1,female
963,GALADRIEL," Tonight you will sleep in peace. Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...",1,female
964,GALADRIEL, Will you look into the mirror?,1,female
965,GALADRIEL, Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror shows many things ... things that were ... things that are ... and some things that have not yet come to pass.,1,female
966,GALADRIEL," I know what it is you saw ... for it is also in my mind. It is the future, Frodo. It is what will come to pass if you should fail.",1,female
967,GALADRIEL, You offer it to me freely ... I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.,1,female
968,GALADRIEL," In place of the Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the Sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth ... All shall love me and despair!",1,female
969,GALADRIEL," You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone.",1,female
970,GALADRIEL, Even the smallest person can change,1,female
971,GALADRIEL, And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?,1,female
972,GALADRIEL, I have nothing greater to give than the gift you already bear.,1,female
973,GALADRIEL," That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.",1,female
974,GALADRIEL," The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun. He will try to take the Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all.",1,female
975,GALADRIEL," I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain  Galadriel.",1,female
976,GALADRIEL," This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant. And I am its keeper.",1,female
977,GALADRIEL, This task was appointed to you. And,1,female
978,GALADRIEL," Am meleth dîn. I ant e-guil Arwen Undómiel ... pelitha. For her love, I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar ... will diminish.",1,female
979,GALADRIEL, To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.,1,female
980,GALADRIEL, Namárië. Farewell.,1,female
981,GALADRIEL," Nadath nâ i moe cerich. Dan ... ú-'eveditham, Elessar. There is much you have yet to do. We shall not meet again, Elessar.",1,female
982,GALADRIEL," I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star.",1,female
267,GANDALF," A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.",1,male
268,GANDALF, You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo’s birthday?,1,male
269,GANDALF," What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural... Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past age. Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits...",1,male
270,GANDALF," Well, that should please him.",1,male
271,GANDALF, What?,1,male
272,GANDALF," Good gracious, me.",1,male
273,GANDALF, Indeed?,1,male
274,GANDALF, If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon ... I was barely involved ...all I did was give your uncle a little nudge out the door.,1,male
275,GANDALF," Oh, really?",1,male
276,GANDALF," So am I, dear boy...so am I.",1,male
277,GANDALF, And what about very old friends?,1,male
278,GANDALF, Bilbo Baggins!,1,male
279,GANDALF," Good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it?",1,male
280,GANDALF," Just tea, thank you.",1,male
281,GANDALF," No, not at all. Go ahead.",1,male
282,GANDALF," So, you mean to go through with your plan, then?",1,male
283,GANDALF, Frodo suspects something.,1,male
284,GANDALF," You will tell him, won't you?",1,male
285,GANDALF, He’s very fond of you.,1,male
286,GANDALF," Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took ... I might have known!",1,male
287,GANDALF, I suppose you think that was terribly clever?,1,male
288,GANDALF," There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.",1,male
289,GANDALF, Two eyes. As often as I can spare them.,1,male
290,GANDALF, What about this ring of yours? Is that staying too?,1,male
291,GANDALF," I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?",1,male
292,GANDALF, There's no need to get angry.,1,male
293,GANDALF," Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you.",1,male
294,GANDALF, I think you've had that ring quite long enough.,1,male
295,GANDALF," Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks!",1,male
296,GANDALF, Bilbo?,1,male
297,GANDALF, The Ring is still in your pocket.,1,male
298,GANDALF," I'm sure you will, my dear friend.",1,male
299,GANDALF," Goodbye, Bilbo.",1,male
300,GANDALF, Riddles in the dark.,1,male
301,GANDALF, My precious ... precious...,1,male
302,GANDALF, ...my own.,1,male
303,GANDALF, Bilbo’s ring.,1,male
304,GANDALF, There are things I must to see to.,1,male
305,GANDALF, Questions. Questions that need answering.,1,male
306,GANDALF," Neither do I. Keep it secret, Keep it safe.",1,male
307,GANDALF," The year 3434 of the Second Age ... here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the Ring of Power.",1,male
308,GANDALF," It has come to me ... the Ring of Power! It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom ... all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I will risk no hurt to the ring ... it is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain...",1,male
309,GANDALF," The marking on the band begin to fade ... the writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared ... a secret now that only fire can tell...",1,male
310,GANDALF, Is it secret? Is it safe?,1,male
311,GANDALF," Hold out your hand, Frodo ... it is quite cool.",1,male
312,GANDALF," There are few who can ... the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.",1,male
313,GANDALF," In the common tongue, it says: “One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them. One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.”",1,male
314,GANDALF," This is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron, in the fires of Mount Doom ... taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.",1,male
315,GANDALF," Yes. For sixty years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo’s keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age ... but no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It's heard its master's call.",1,male
316,GANDALF," No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied ... his fortress of Barad-dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. For the Ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it.",1,male
317,GANDALF," There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first.",1,male
318,GANDALF," No, Frodo...",1,male
319,GANDALF, You cannot offer me this ring.,1,male
320,GANDALF," Don't tempt me, Frodo! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe.",1,male
321,GANDALF," No, no, it can't.",1,male
322,GANDALF," You must leave, and leave quickly. Get out of the Shire.",1,male
323,GANDALF, Make for the village of Bree.,1,male
324,GANDALF, I will be waiting for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony.,1,male
325,GANDALF," I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the Head of my Order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He’ll know what to do.",1,male
326,GANDALF, You’ll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you ... for that name is not safe outside the Shire.,1,male
327,GANDALF," My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.",1,male
328,GANDALF," It’s a little bit late for trimming the hedges, don’t you think?",1,male
329,GANDALF, What did you hear? Speak!,1,male
330,GANDALF, No?,1,male
331,GANDALF, Saruman!,1,male
332,GANDALF, Beyond any doubt.,1,male
333,GANDALF," All these long years, it was in the Shire, under my very nose.",1,male
334,GANDALF, We still have time ... time enough to counter Sauron ... if we act quickly.,1,male
335,GANDALF, The Eye of Sauron.,1,male
336,GANDALF, You know this? How?,1,male
337,GANDALF," A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman.",1,male
338,GANDALF," They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones. We do not know who else may be watching.",1,male
339,GANDALF, The Nine?,1,male
340,GANDALF, They have reached the Shire?,1,male
341,GANDALF," Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?",1,male
342,GANDALF," Yes, I'm here. And you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.",1,male
343,GANDALF," I am sorry, Frodo.",1,male
344,GANDALF, There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will ... and he does not share power.,1,male
345,GANDALF," Nothing, Frodo...",1,male
346,GANDALF, Sam has hardly left your side.,1,male
347,GANDALF," By the skills of Lord Elrond, you’re beginning to mend.",1,male
348,GANDALF, That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.,1,male
349,GANDALF, It is a burden he should never have,1,male
350,GANDALF," His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin Men ... He’s breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.",1,male
351,GANDALF, It is in Men that we must place our,1,male
352,GANDALF," There is one who could unite them, one who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.",1,male
353,GANDALF," Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them.",1,male
354,GANDALF," I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West! The Ring is altogether evil.",1,male
355,GANDALF, Aragorn is right ... we cannot use it.,1,male
356,GANDALF," Do you not understand? While we bicker amongst ourselves, Sauron’s power grows! No one will escape it. You will all be destroyed, with your homes burnt and your families put to the sword!",1,male
357,GANDALF," I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.",1,male
358,GANDALF, The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.,1,male
359,GANDALF, Left.,1,male
360,GANDALF," No, Gimli. I would not take the road",1,male
361,GANDALF, Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched.,1,male
362,GANDALF, It’s Saruman!,1,male
363,GANDALF," No! Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i ruith. Sleep, Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath.",1,male
364,GANDALF, Let the Ring-bearer decide.,1,male
365,GANDALF, So be it.,1,male
366,GANDALF," Frodo, come and help an old man.",1,male
367,GANDALF, How is your shoulder?,1,male
368,GANDALF," And the Ring? You feel its power growing, don’t you? I’ve felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship. And, I fear, from within.",1,male
369,GANDALF, You must trust yourself. Trust your own strengths.,1,male
370,GANDALF, There are many powers in this world for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. And against some I have not yet been tested.,1,male
371,GANDALF," Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.",1,male
372,GANDALF, Isildin ... it mirrors only starlight and moonlight.,1,male
373,GANDALF," It’s simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.",1,male
374,GANDALF," Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen. Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.",1,male
375,GANDALF," I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves, Men, and Orcs.",1,male
376,GANDALF," Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will try to find the opening words.",1,male
377,GANDALF," Ando Eldarinwa ... a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa... Gate of Elves ... listen to my word, Threshold of Dwarves...",1,male
378,GANDALF, Oh,1,male
379,GANDALF, Into the mines!,1,male
380,GANDALF, Now we have but one choice ... we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard ... there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.,1,male
381,GANDALF," Quietly, now. It’s a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed.",1,male
382,GANDALF, The wealth of Moria was not in gold or jewels but mithril.,1,male
383,GANDALF, Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.,1,male
384,GANDALF," Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.",1,male
385,GANDALF, I have no memory of this place.,1,male
386,GANDALF, It's Gollum.,1,male
387,GANDALF, He's been following us for three days.,1,male
388,GANDALF," Escaped ... or was set loose. And now the Ring has drawn him here ... he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Sméagol’s life is a sad story.",1,male
389,GANDALF," Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to  them, Frodo?",1,male
390,GANDALF," So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.",1,male
391,GANDALF," No. But the air doesn’t smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose! Yes...",1,male
392,GANDALF, Let me risk a little more light.,1,male
393,GANDALF, Behold! The great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.,1,male
394,GANDALF, Gimli!!,1,male
395,GANDALF," “Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.” He is dead, then. It’s as I feared.",1,male
396,GANDALF, “They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates ... but cannot hold them for long ... the ground shakes ... drums drums in the deep ... we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will no-one save us? They are coming.”,1,male
397,GANDALF," Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!",1,male
398,GANDALF, I think there’s more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.,1,male
399,GANDALF, To the bridge of Khazad-Dûm!,1,male
400,GANDALF, This way!,1,male
401,GANDALF, A Balrog ... a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you! Run! Quickly!,1,male
402,GANDALF," Lead them on, Aragorn! The bridge is near.",1,male
403,GANDALF, Over the bridge! Fly!,1,male
404,GANDALF," I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn.",1,male
405,GANDALF, You shall not pass!!,1,male
406,GANDALF," Fly, you fools!",1,male
407,GANDALF," ...for which I am very thankful. So, how is the old rascal? I hear this is to be a party of special magnificence.",1,male
408,GANDALF, You haven't aged a day.,1,male
409,GANDALF, I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to help you.,1,male
410,GANDALF, All your long years we’ve been friends ... trust me as you once did. Let it go!,1,male
411,GANDALF, Until our next meeting.,1,male
412,GANDALF, He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's left you Bag End...,1,male
413,GANDALF, ...along with all his possessions.,1,male
414,GANDALF, The ring is yours now. Put it somewhere out of sight.,1,male
415,GANDALF, What can you see? Can you see anything?,1,male
416,GANDALF," Understand, Frodo ... I would use this Ring from a desire to do good ... but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.",1,male
417,GANDALF, Travel only by day. And stay off the road.,1,male
418,GANDALF, Get down!,1,male
419,GANDALF," Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have you been eavesdropping?",1,male
420,GANDALF, Perhaps not. I’ve thought of a better use for you.,1,male
421,GANDALF, Is it safe?,1,male
422,GANDALF," Never put it on, for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power... Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master ... it wants to be found.",1,male
423,GANDALF, I was delayed.,1,male
424,GANDALF, We must take the Pass of Caradhras!,1,male
425,GANDALF, Frodo?,1,male
426,GANDALF," It reads, “The door of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.”",1,male

428,GANDALF," Yes ... Sméagol he was once called ... Before the Ring came to him, before it drove him mad.",1,male
429,GANDALF," Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment ... even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.",1,male
430,GANDALF," There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it ... and that is an encouraging thought. Ah! It's that way.",1,male
431,GANDALF, Do as I say; Swords are no more use,1,male
432,GANDALF, You cannot pass!,1,male
433,GANDALF, Go back to the Shadow!,1,male
637,GANDALF," I don't know how long they tortured him ... but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.",1,male
638,GANDALF," Come along, Samwise ... keep up...",1,male
639,GANDALF," Be careful, both of you. The Enemy has many spies in his service, many ways of hearing ... birds, beasts...",1,male
640,GANDALF," We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for forty days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there, our road turns east, to Mordor.",1,male
641,GANDALF, So do all who live to see such times... but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.,1,male

853,GIMLI, Then ... what are we waiting for?,1,male
854,GIMLI, And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?,1,male
855,GIMLI, I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!,1,male
856,GIMLI, And my axe.,1,male
857,GIMLI," If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round. Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal  welcome.",1,male
858,GIMLI, Nothing ... it’s just a wisp of cloud.,1,male
859,GIMLI, We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the Mines of Moria.,1,male
860,GIMLI, The Walls of Moria!,1,male
861,GIMLI, Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.,1,male
862,GIMLI," Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone! This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin ... And they call this a mine. A mine!",1,male
863,GIMLI, Oh ... no ... no ... no...!,1,male

869,GIMLI, Nobody tosses a dwarf!,1,male
870,GIMLI," Stay close, young Hobbits ... they say a great sorceress lives in these woods. An Elf-witch of terrible power. All who look upon her fall under her spell...",1,male
871,GIMLI, And are never seen again!,1,male
872,GIMLI," Well, here’s one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!",1,male
873,GIMLI, So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words we can also understand!,1,male
874,GIMLI, And you know what this Dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! I spit on your grave!,1,male
875,GIMLI, Nothing.,1,male
876,GIMLI, I have taken my worst wound at this,1,male
877,GIMLI, I asked her for one hair from her,1,male
878,GIMLI," Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. And after that, it gets even better ... a festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.",1,male
879,GIMLI, Recover my...,1,male
880,GIMLI, Then it has all been in vain ... the Fellowship has failed.,1,male
881,GIMLI, Yes! Ha!,1,male
882,GIMLI, Never trust an Elf!,1,male
883,GIMLI, Except to look upon the lady of the more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.,1,male
884,GIMLI," Actually... There was one thing. No, no, I couldn’t. It’s quite impossible. Stupid to ask.",1,male
57,GOLLUM," My Precious... The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.",1,male

950,HALDIR," There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood. It is clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and whither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it of late.",1,male

Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey.

648,SARUMAN, Are you sure of this?,1,male
649,SARUMAN, So the Ring of Power has been found?,1,male

651,SARUMAN, Time? What time do you think we have?,1,male
652,SARUMAN," Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form ... but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf ... a Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.",1,male

662,SARUMAN, Rip them all down.,1,male
663,SARUMAN, A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.,1,male

992,SAURON, They will fall!,1,male
693,STRIDER, You draw far too much attention to yourself ... Mr. Underhill.,1,male
694,STRIDER, A little more caution from you ... that is no trinket you carry.,1,male
695,STRIDER," Indeed? I can avoid being seen if I wish, but to disappear entirely ... that is a rare gift.",1,male
696,STRIDER, Are you frightened?,1,male
697,STRIDER, Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.,1,male
