442,ARAGORN, They must be warned!,3,male
443,ARAGORN, The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid!,3,male
444,ARAGORN, You ride with us?,3,male
445,ARAGORN, Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.,3,male
446,ARAGORN, Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We have till dawn. Then we must ride.,3,male
447,ARAGORN, My Lord Elrond.,3,male
448,ARAGORN, She stayed?,3,male
449,ARAGORN," It will not be our end, but his.",3,male
450,ARAGORN, There are none.,3,male
451,ARAGORN," Murderers, traitors - You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one.",3,male
452,ARAGORN, Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil...,3,male
453,ARAGORN, Ú-chebin estel anim. I keep none for myself.,3,male
454,ARAGORN, Éowyn...,3,male
455,ARAGORN, Why have you come?,3,male
456,ARAGORN, It is but a shadow and a thought that you love ... I cannot give you what you seek.,3,male
457,ARAGORN," Not this time ... This time you must stay, my friend.",3,male
458,ARAGORN, Brego!,3,male
459,ARAGORN, One who will have your allegiance.,3,male
460,ARAGORN, You will suffer me!,3,male
461,ARAGORN, I summon you to fulfill your oath!,3,male

465,ARAGORN," If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.",3,male
466,ARAGORN, No.,3,male
467,ARAGORN, Draw out Sauron's armies - empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.,3,male
468,ARAGORN, Not for ourselves ... But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves.,3,male
469,ARAGORN, Let the lord of the Black Land come forth; let justice be done upon him.,3,male
470,ARAGORN, Pull back! Pull back!,3,male
471,ARAGORN, Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons of Gondor - of Rohan ... my brothers!,3,male

478,ARAGORN, What say you?,3,male
479,ARAGORN, What say you?,3,male
480,ARAGORN, There's still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the Plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.,3,male
481,ARAGORN," I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails; when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship; but it is not this day - an hour of wolves and shattered shields, when the Age of Men comes crashing down - but it is not this day!! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth - I bid you stand!",3,male
482,ARAGORN, Men of the West!,3,male

528,ARWEN, There is also life.,3,female
529,ARWEN, But it is not lost...,3,female
530,ARWEN," Some things are certain. If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. Ada, it is time.",3,female
531,ARWEN, Ada...,3,female
532,ARWEN," This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.",3,female
545,ARWEN, You saw there was a child... you saw my son.,3,female

547,ARWEN, The crownless again shall be King...,3,female
548,ARWEN, Reforge the sword.,3,female
549,ARWEN," I choose a mortal life ... I wish I could have seen him, one last time...",3,female
701,BILBO," Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?",3,male
703,BILBO, Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine ... the one I gave you?,3,male
704,BILBO, Oh ... pity. I should like to have held it one last time.,3,male
705,BILBO," Oh! Well, here’s a sight I have never seen before.",3,male
706,BILBO, I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.,3,male
558,DENETHOR, Perhaps you come to explain this?,3,male
559,DENETHOR," You think you are wise,  Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor, and with your right you would seek to supplant me.",3,male
560,DENETHOR," The rule of Gondor is mine, and no other's!",3,male
561,DENETHOR," And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given...",3,male
562,DENETHOR, ...fealty with love...,3,male
563,DENETHOR, I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses; defenses that your brother long held intact.,3,male
564,DENETHOR, I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.,3,male
565,DENETHOR, Much must be risked in war. Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will?,3,male
566,DENETHOR," Yes, I wish that.",3,male
567,DENETHOR, That will depend on the manner of your return.,3,male
568,DENETHOR," Can you sing, Master Hobbit?",3,male
569,DENETHOR," And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!",3,male
570,DENETHOR, Faramir!,3,male
571,DENETHOR, My son is dead. My line has ended.,3,male
572,DENETHOR, The House of Stewards has failed!...,3,male
573,DENETHOR, My line has ended.,3,male
574,DENETHOR, Rohan has deserted us.,3,male
575,DENETHOR," No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long, slow, sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.",3,male
576,DENETHOR, The house of his spirit crumbles! He is burning ... already burning.,3,male
577,DENETHOR," Hear now, Peregrin, son of Paladin ... I release you from my service...",3,male
578,DENETHOR, Set a fire in our flesh!,3,male
579,DENETHOR, No! Do not take my son from me!,3,male
580,DENETHOR, Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.,3,male
581,DENETHOR," I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North, last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship.",3,male
582,DENETHOR, ...valor with honor...,3,male
583,DENETHOR, ...disloyalty with vengeance.,3,male
584,DENETHOR, Say not that he has fallen...,3,male
585,DENETHOR, Théoden's betrayed me.,3,male
586,DENETHOR, Abandon your posts!,3,male
587,DENETHOR, Flee! Flee for your lives!,3,male
588,DENETHOR, Bring wood and oil!,3,male
589,DENETHOR, Go now and die in what way seems best to you.,3,male
590,DENETHOR, Faramir...,3,male
688,DENETHOR, Pour oil on the wood!,3,male
0,DÉAGOL," Sméagol, I've got one! I've got a fish, Sméagol!",3,male
1,DÉAGOL, Why?,3,male
521,ELROND, Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea ... the last journey of Arwen Undómiel.,3,male
522,ELROND," Arwen, there is nothing for you here ... only death.",3,male
533,ELROND, Arwen?,3,male
534,ELROND, I looked into your future and I saw death.,3,male
535,ELROND, That future is almost gone.,3,male
536,ELROND, Nothing is certain.,3,male
537,ELROND, Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.,3,male
538,ELROND, I come on behalf of one whom I love.,3,male
539,ELROND, She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.,3,male
540,ELROND," You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river...",3,male
541,ELROND, There are those who dwell in the mountain.,3,male
542,ELROND, They will answer to the King of Gondor.,3,male
543,ELROND, The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.,3,male
544,ELROND, I Aear can vên na mar. The Sea calls us home.,3,male
550,ELROND, It has begun.,3,male
551,ELROND, Arwen is dying.,3,male
552,ELROND," The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the end has come.",3,male
553,ELROND, A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.,3,male
554,ELROND," They'll be in the city in two days... You're outnumbered, Aragorn. You need more men.",3,male
555,ELROND," Andúril, flame of the West, forged from the Shards of Narsil.",3,male
556,ELROND, Put aside the Ranger - become who you were born to be - take the Dimholt road.,3,male
557,ELROND, Ónen i-Estel Edain. I give hope to Men.,3,male
607,FARAMIR, To the river - quick!,3,male
608,FARAMIR, Tell the Men to break up. We ride for Minas Tirith.,3,male
609,FARAMIR, Take cover!,3,male
610,FARAMIR, Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!,3,male
611,FARAMIR, Mithrandir!,3,male
612,FARAMIR, No.,3,male
613,FARAMIR," In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf - they are taking the road to the Morgul Vale.",3,male
614,FARAMIR, What would you have me do?,3,male
615,FARAMIR," My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.",3,male
616,FARAMIR," You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived?",3,male
617,FARAMIR," Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead.",3,male
618,FARAMIR," If I should return ... think better of me, father.",3,male
619,FARAMIR, Where does my allegiance lie if not here?,3,male
640,FARAMIR, They broke through our defenses. They have taken the bridge and the West Bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the River.,3,male
523,FIGWIT, Lady Arwen?,3,male
524,FIGWIT, We cannot delay.,3,male
525,FIGWIT, My Lady!,3,male
146,FRODO, No ... no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.,3,male
147,FRODO, What about you?,3,male
148,FRODO, Sam.,3,male
149,FRODO, For what?,3,male
150,FRODO," No, Sam! Leave him alone!",3,male
151,FRODO, Sam...,3,male
152,FRODO," Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.",3,male
153,FRODO, I'm not sending him away.,3,male
154,FRODO," We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.",3,male
155,FRODO," I know, Sam. I know. You must trust me.",3,male
156,FRODO, They're calling me!,3,male
157,FRODO, I can feel his blade!,3,male
158,FRODO, It's dark still.,3,male
159,FRODO, What? That's all we have left!,3,male
160,FRODO, He doesn't eat it ... he can't have taken it.,3,male
161,FRODO, Sam! Stop it!,3,male
162,FRODO," No, Sam!",3,male
163,FRODO, I'm alright.,3,male
164,FRODO, Get away!,3,male
165,FRODO," No, Sam ... it's you.",3,male
166,FRODO, You can't help me anymore.,3,male
167,FRODO, Go home.,3,male
168,FRODO, What is this place?,3,male
169,FRODO," Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.",3,male
170,FRODO, I can't go back.,3,male
171,FRODO, What's that smell?,3,male
172,FRODO, Sméagol!,3,male
173,FRODO, It's sticky ... What is it?,3,male
174,FRODO, Sméagol! Sméagol!,3,male
175,FRODO, Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima! Hail Eärendil brightest of the Stars!,3,male
176,FRODO," I have to destroy it, Sméagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes.",3,male
177,FRODO," I'm so sorry, Sam.",3,male
178,FRODO, Sam!!!,3,male
179,FRODO, It's too late. It's over ... they've taken it. Sam - they took the Ring!,3,male
180,FRODO, Give it to me.,3,male
181,FRODO, There are so many of them ... So many. We’ll never get through unseen.,3,male
182,FRODO," There'll be none left for the return journey. I don't think there will be a return journey, Mister Frodo.",3,male
183,FRODO," No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food; nor the sound of water; nor the touch of grass ... I'm naked in the dark. There's no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see him with my waking eyes!",3,male
184,FRODO," I'm here, Sam.",3,male
185,FRODO, The Ring is mine.,3,male
186,FRODO, It's gone ... it's done.,3,male
187,FRODO," I can see the Shire ... The Brandywine River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks ... the lights in the Party Tree...",3,male
188,FRODO," I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.",3,male
189,FRODO, Gandalf?,3,male
190,FRODO," It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.",3,male
191,FRODO, Not quite ... There's room for a little more.,3,male
192,FRODO," Sorry, Uncle ... I'm afraid, I lost it.",3,male
193,FRODO," We set out to save the Shire, and it has been saved ... but not for me...",3,male
194,FRODO," The last pages are for you, Sam.",3,male
495,FRODO," Come, Sméagol.",3,male
496,FRODO," I'm sorry, Sam...",3,male
497,FRODO, Sméagol!,3,male
498,FRODO, Sam.,3,male
499,FRODO, ...so sorry...,3,male
500,FRODO," Oh, Sam ... I'm so sorry ... sorry for everything.",3,male
501,FRODO," Give me the Ring, Sam.",3,male
502,FRODO, Sam! Give me the Ring.,3,male
503,FRODO," You must understand ... The Ring is my burden ... It will destroy you, Sam.",3,male
504,FRODO, It's him - the Eye.,3,male
695,FRODO," And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle- earth began, and the Fellowship of the Ring, though eternally bound by friendship and love, was ended. Thirteen months to the day, since Gandalf sent us on our long journey...",3,male
696,FRODO, ...we found ourselves looking upon a familiar site ... We were home!,3,male
697,FRODO," How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand. There is no going back. There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep. That have taken hold.",3,male
698,FRODO," Bilbo once told me, the great stories never end - that each of us must come and go in the telling. His part in this tale was now over. There would be no more journeys for Bilbo. Save one.",3,male
699,FRODO," My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Because Sam, your part in the journey goes on.",3,male
702,FRODO," To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have accorded you a special honor. A place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.",3,male
673,GALADRIEL," I give you the light of Eärendil - our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.",3,female
674,GALADRIEL," This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way ... no one will.",3,female
675,GALADRIEL, The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men.,3,female
649,GAMLING," None have come, My Lord.",3,male
652,GAMLING, Lord Aragorn!,3,male
653,GAMLING, He leaves because there is no hope.,3,male
654,GAMLING, Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.,3,male
278,GANDALF, Hobbits.,3,male
279,GANDALF," And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard.",3,male
280,GANDALF, No. He has no power any more.,3,male
281,GANDALF," Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad.",3,male
282,GANDALF, No word ... nothing.,3,male
283,GANDALF, Do we know that?,3,male
284,GANDALF," That Frodo is alive. Yes - yes, he is alive.",3,male
285,GANDALF, Fool of a Took!,3,male
286,GANDALF, Look at me! What did you see?,3,male
287,GANDALF, Minas Tirith?? Is that what you saw?,3,male
288,GANDALF, What did you tell him? Speak!,3,male
289,GANDALF, What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?,3,male
290,GANDALF," There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.",3,male
291,GANDALF, No!,3,male
292,GANDALF," They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river, look to the black ships. Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone.",3,male
293,GANDALF," Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry, hurry!",3,male
294,GANDALF," Three days ride, as the Nazgûl flies, and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.",3,male
295,GANDALF, Run Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste.,3,male
296,GANDALF, We have just passed into the realm of Gondor.,3,male
297,GANDALF, Minas Tirith ... City of the Kings.,3,male
298,GANDALF," Yes, the White Tree of Gondor. The tree of the King.",3,male
299,GANDALF," Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise ... And do not mention Frodo ... Or the Ring ... And say nothing of Aragorn, either. In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.",3,male
300,GANDALF," Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.",3,male
301,GANDALF, Pippin!,3,male
302,GANDALF," Get up! My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?",3,male
303,GANDALF, Authority is not given you to deny the return of the King - Steward!,3,male
304,GANDALF, Come.,3,male
305,GANDALF," You're in the service of the Steward Now - You're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took... Guard of the Citadel!",3,male
306,GANDALF, It's the deep breath before the plunge.,3,male
307,GANDALF, There never was much hope.,3,male
308,GANDALF, This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall the hardest.,3,male
309,GANDALF, The Witch-King of Angmar... You've met him before...,3,male
310,GANDALF, We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time.,3,male
311,GANDALF," The board is set, the pieces are moving.",3,male
312,GANDALF," Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth!",3,male
313,GANDALF, Amon Dîn ... come on...,3,male
314,GANDALF, Hope is kindled.,3,male
315,GANDALF, Foreseen and done nothing!,3,male
316,GANDALF, Where? When?,3,male
317,GANDALF, ...And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.,3,male
318,GANDALF, Faramir ... Tell me everything.,3,male
319,GANDALF, Courage is the best defense that you have now.,3,male
320,GANDALF, Faramir! Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly!,3,male
321,GANDALF," Your father loves you, Faramir! And will remember it before the end.",3,male
322,GANDALF, To the Black Ships...,3,male
323,GANDALF, Prepare for battle!,3,male
324,GANDALF, Return to your posts!,3,male
325,GANDALF, Send these foul beasts into the abyss!,3,male
326,GANDALF, Stand to your posts! Do not give in to fear. Fight!,3,male
327,GANDALF, This is no place for a Hobbit!,3,male
328,GANDALF," Guard of the Citadel, indeed! Now, back up the hill - quickly! Quickly!",3,male
329,GANDALF, To the Gates! Man the Gates!,3,male
330,GANDALF, Steady! Steady!,3,male
331,GANDALF, Fire!,3,male
332,GANDALF, Pull back - to the second level! Hurry! Get the women and children out of here - get them out!,3,male
333,GANDALF, Fight! Fight for your lives!,3,male
334,GANDALF, Come! Quickly!,3,male
335,GANDALF, Stay this madness!,3,male
336,GANDALF," So passes Denethor, Son of Ecthelion.",3,male
337,GANDALF," End? No, the journey doesn't end here.",3,male
338,GANDALF, White shores ... And beyond... a far green country under a swift sunrise.,3,male
339,GANDALF," No... No, it isn't.",3,male
340,GANDALF, Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.,3,male
341,GANDALF," It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.",3,male
342,GANDALF, Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.,3,male
343,GANDALF, How?,3,male
344,GANDALF, Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait!,3,male
345,GANDALF, Now come the days of the King...,3,male
346,GANDALF," Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.",3,male
350,GANDALF," Quickly, now!",3,male
351,GANDALF, We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin saw in the Palantír was a glimpse of our enemy's plan.,3,male
352,GANDALF, Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.,3,male
353,GANDALF, The Heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still - strength enough left to challenge him.,3,male
354,GANDALF, Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees the return of the King.,3,male
355,GANDALF," If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war!",3,male
356,GANDALF, I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be going alone!,3,male
357,GANDALF," Lord Denethor, however, is not the king. He is a steward, only. A caretaker of the throne.",3,male
358,GANDALF, I come with tidings in this dark hour - and with counsel.,3,male
359,GANDALF, You still have friends - You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Théoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.,3,male
360,GANDALF, Just a fool's hope.,3,male
361,GANDALF, He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.,3,male
