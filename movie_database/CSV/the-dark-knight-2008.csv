GRUMPY, Three of a kind.  Let's do this.,male
GRUMPY, There's two on the roof.  Every guy is an extra share.  Five shares is plenty.,male
GRUMPY, Yeah?  He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice then I get why they call him the Joker.,male
GRUMPY," Obviously, we don't want you doing anything with your hands other than holding on for dear life.",male
GRUMPY, He's got three left?,male
GRUMPY, Where'd you learn to count?!,male
GRUMPY, A mob bank.  Guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.,male
GRUMPY, Where's the alarm guy?,male
GRUMPY," Funny, he told me something similar...",male
GRUMPY," C'mon, there's a lot to carry...",male
GRUMPY, If this guy was so smart he would have had us bring a bigger car.,male
GRUMPY, I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.,male
GRUMPY, Bus driver?  What bus-,male
ENGEL," Mr Mayor, you were elected on a campaign to clean up the city... when are you going to start?",male
ENGEL, Like this so-called Batman- a lot of people say he's doing some good that criminals are running scared... but I say NO.  What kind of hero needs to wear a mask?  You don't let vigilantes run around breaking the law... where does it end?,male
ENGEL, ...Police released video footage found concealed on the body. Sensitive viewers be aware: it is disturbing.,male
ENGEL," With no word from the Batman- even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb, these cops have to be wondering if the Joker is going to make good on his threat to kill the Mayor today...",male
ENGEL, ...he's a credible source- an A and M lawyer for a prestigious consultancy. He says he's waited as long as he can for the Batman to do the right thing...,male
ENGEL," Now he's taking matters into his own hands.  We'll be live at five with the true identity of the Batman, stay with us...",male
ENGEL," Caller, you're on the air.",male
ENGEL," Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want Batman to give himself up, is this the right thing to do?",male
ENGEL," And we wish him a speedy recovery. God knows we need him, now.  Let's take another call-",male
ENGEL, Who is this?,male
ENGEL, Commissioner?!  You really think someone would try to-,male
ENGEL, Thanks.,male
MAYOR," Well, Mike-",male
MAYOR, I'm told our men in the Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.,male
MAYOR, DENT!  What was that circus?!,male
MAYOR, 549 criminals at once?!  How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?,male
MAYOR," Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo, you'll set a new record at appeals for quickest kick in the ass.",male
MAYOR," The public likes you, Dent.  That's the only reason this might fly.",male
MAYOR, Followed swiftly by you and me-,male
MAYOR, Back from the dead.,male
MAYOR, What do we got?,male
MAYOR," Go home, Gordon.  The clown'll keep till morning.  Get some rest- you're going to need it.  Tomorrow, you take the big job. You don't have any say in the matter. Commissioner Gordon.",male
MAYOR, Land routes East?,male
MAYOR, The men you and Dent put away?  Those aren't people I'm worried about.,male
ENGEL," Yet, we hear rumors that instead of trying to arrest him the cops are using him to do their dirty work.",male
RAMIREZ," Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're closing in on the Batman.",male
RAMIREZ," Ever intending to see your wife again, Lieutenant?",male
RAMIREZ, They checked her back into hospital.,male
RAMIREZ, Least there she's got someone round the clock.  Unlike your wife. He hasn't shown?,male
RAMIREZ, Why wouldn't he come?,male
RAMIREZ, He can't resist showing us his face.,male
RAMIREZ," Give us a minute, please, people!",male
RAMIREZ, You're gonna want to see this.,male
RAMIREZ, That Joker card pinned to the body? Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..,male
RAMIREZ, All three.,male
RAMIREZ," The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.",male
RAMIREZ, City hall.,male
RAMIREZ, Harvey Dent.,male
RAMIREZ, Us contaminate it?  It's because of you that these guys are dead in the first place-,male
RAMIREZ, Let him be!  He's been through enough-,male
RAMIREZ," I figured, counselor.",male
RAMIREZ," 250, 52nd street.  Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.",male
RAMIREZ, I didn't know-,male
RAMIREZ, I'm sorry- they got me early on.  My mother's medical bills and my-,male
RAMIREZ," I took a little from them- once they've got you, they keep you.  I'm sorry.",male
GORDON," I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective.",male
GORDON, I'm sorry.,male
GORDON, Often doesn't.  But I like reminding everybody that he's out there.,male
GORDON, Hopefully...  Because he's busy.,male
GORDON," Put this out, by morning we can put a big top over central holding and sell tickets.  What's he hiding under that makeup?",male
GORDON, Another bunch of small timers.,male
GORDON, My detectives have been making drug buys with them for weeks.  This bank was another drop for the mob.  That makes five banks- we've found the bulk of their dirty cash.,male
GORDON, What about this Joker guy?,male
GORDON," We'll have to hit all banks simultaneously.  SWAT teams, backup.",male
GORDON," When the new DA gets wind of this, he'll want in.",male
GORDON, Be hard to keep him out.,male
GORDON, I hear he's as stubborn as you.,male
GORDON, Word is you've got a hell of a right cross.  Shame Sal's going to walk.,male
GORDON, We liaise with various agencies-,male
GORDON, Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.,male
GORDON," If you have any concerns about... malfunctioning equipment... take them up with maintenance, counselor.",male
GORDON," In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.",male
GORDON, If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while you were making your name at I.A.- I'd be working alone.  I don't get political points for being an idealist- I have to do the best I can with what I have.,male
GORDON, I can give you the names of the banks.,male
GORDON," You don't have to sell me, Dent.  We all know you're Gotham's white knight.",male
GORDON," Yeah?  All that was left in the vaults were the marked bills- they knew we were coming!  As soon as your office got involved, there's a leak-",male
GORDON," Don't try to cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.",male
GORDON, We're going after the mob's life savings.  Things will get ugly.,male
GORDON, He does that.,male
GORDON, Charge them with what?,male
GORDON, He can't go to County.  I'll keep him here in the holding cells.,male
GORDON, You trust them over at County?,male
GORDON, Lau stays.,male
GORDON," I am, counselor.",male
GORDON, Our boy looks good on the tube.,male
GORDON," Don't worry, they're coming, too.",male
GORDON," Forty-nine, sir.",male
GORDON, Any matches?,male
GORDON," The Joker's telling us who he's targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get them both into protective custody. Where's the Commissioner?",male
GORDON, Seal the building.  No one in or out till I get there.,male
GORDON," We're secure.  I want a floor-by- floor search of the entire building. I'm sorry, sir.  We believe the Joker has made a threat against your life.",male
GORDON," Sir, the Joker card had a trace of your D.N.A. on it-",male
GORDON, Somebody with access to your house or office must've lifted a tissue or a glass...,male
GORDON, Wait-,male
GORDON, Get a medic!,male
GORDON," As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds.",male
GORDON, What about Dent?,male
GORDON, Patrick Harvey.  Richard Dent...,male
GORDON, Ramirez.,male
GORDON, That's brick- you're gonna try and take ballistics off a shattered bullet?,male
GORDON," Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast, 'cos we know his next target...",male
GORDON, How's it looking up top?,male
GORDON," We got you, you son of a bitch.",male
GORDON," We got him, Harvey.",male
GORDON," Stand away!  All of you.  I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, understand?  Handle this guy like he's made of glass.",male
GORDON, I couldn't chance my family's safety.,male
GORDON," Nothing.  No matches on prints, DNA, dental.  Clothing is custom, no labels.  Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.  No name, no other alias... nothing.",male
GORDON, I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't risk-,male
GORDON," Actually, this time I saved him.",male
GORDON," Has he said anything, yet?",male
GORDON, Harvey Dent never made it home.,male
GORDON, What have you done with him?,male
GORDON, Where is he?,male
GORDON, What difference does that make?,male
GORDON," If we're going to play games, I'm going to need a cup of coffee.",male
GORDON, Not exactly.,male
GORDON, He's in control.,male
GORDON, Which one are you-,male
GORDON, With Lau? The Joker planned to be caught.  He wanted me to lock him up in M.C.U..,male
GORDON, I'm sorry about Rachel. The Doctor says you're in agonizing pain but you won't accept medication. That you're refusing skin grafts-,male
GORDON," Harvey, I can't-",male
GORDON, Two-face.  Harvey two-face.,male
GORDON," I... I know you tried to warn me. I'm sorry.  Wuertz picked you up- was he working for them? Do you know who picked up Rachel? Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust.",male
GORDON," I'm sorry, Harvey.",male
GORDON, You should have thought of that before you let the clown out of the box.,male
GORDON," Call in every officer- tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search.  Call the transit authority, school board, prisons- get every available bus down to a hospital- the priority is Gotham General- wheel everybody out of that place right now- my hunch is that's where the bomb is.",male
GORDON, That's where Harvey Dent is.,male
GORDON, To get Reese.,male
GORDON, Get the cars around back!,male
GORDON," Well, maybe Batman will save you.",male
GORDON," Berg, isn't it?",male
GORDON," You okay, son?",male
GORDON," I'm gonna need your weapon, son.",male
GORDON, Yeah.  That would be why.,male
GORDON," You okay, Mr.Wayne?",male
GORDON," That was a brave thing, you did.",male
GORDON, You weren't protecting the van?,male
GORDON," You don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, Mr.Wayne?",male
GORDON," Not today, I wouldn't.",male
GORDON, Gotham general... Did you get Dent out?,male
GORDON," You must know how many were inside- you've got patient lists, roll calls-",male
GORDON, Yeah?  What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is?,male
GORDON, Keep looking.  Keep it to yourself.,male
GORDON," My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges, but with the Joker's threat they're not and option.",male
GORDON," Backed up for hours.  Which leaves the ferries with thirty thousand waiting to board.  Plus, corrections are at capacity, so I want to use a ferry to take some prisoners off the island.",male
GORDON," You should be- they're the people you least want to be stuck with in an emergency.  Whatever the Joker's planning, it's a good bet that Harvey's prisoners might be involved. I want 'em out of here.",male
GORDON, Then we have a hostage situation.,male
GORDON, It's a shooting gallery.  Why'd he choose a spot with such big windows?,male
GORDON, Let's do it.,male
GORDON," What's simple, is that every second we don't take him, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing each other up!",male
GORDON, Then he'll blow them both up! There's no time- we have to go in now-,male
GORDON, That's why we can't wait- we can't play his games-,male
GORDON, No.  There's no time.  We have clear shots.,male
GORDON, Dent's in there with them.  We have to save Dent!  I have to save Dent! Get ready-,male
GORDON, Two minutes.  Then you breach.,male
GORDON," Hello?  Barbara, calm down-",male
GORDON, Harvey?  What the hell's going on?,male
GORDON, Dent?,male
GORDON, I know.  I was here.  Trying to save her.,male
GORDON, I couldn't.,male
GORDON, I was trying to fight the mob-,male
GORDON, Harvey.  Put the gun down.  You're not going to hurt my family.,male
GORDON, Put the gun down.,male
GORDON," Please, Harvey...",male
GORDON," Goddamit.  Stop pointing that gun at my family, Dent.",male
GORDON," I'm sorry, Harvey.  For everything. But, please.  Please don't hurt him.",male
GORDON," All they know is there's a situation. They don't know who, or what. They're just creating a perimeter.",male
GORDON," No one needs to escape, because no one's done anything wrong.  And nobody has to.",male
GORDON," You're right, Harvey.  Rachel's death was my fault.  But punish me-",male
GORDON," It's going to be all right, son.",male
GORDON, Thank-you.,male
GORDON," Yes, I do.",male
GORDON, The Joker won.,male
GORDON," Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for, everything Rachel died for.  Undone.  Whatever chance Gotham had of fixing itself... whatever chance you gave us of fixing our city...  dies with Harvey's reputation.  We bet it all on him. The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.  People will lose all hope.",male
GORDON, Five dead?  Two of them cops?  We can't sweep that under-,male
GORDON, You?  You can't-,male
GORDON," No, you can't!  You're not!",male
GORDON, ...a hero.  Not the hero we deserved- the hero we needed.  Nothing less than a knight.  Shining...,male
GORDON, Because we have to chase him...,male
GORDON, Because...,male
CHECHEN, That's why we bring dogs.,male
CHECHEN, My little princes... The Batman's invisible to you fools... but my little princes... they can find human meat in complete darkness.,male
CHECHEN, Look!  Look what your drugs did to my customers!,male
CHECHEN, My business is repeat customers.,male
CHECHEN," Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are hungry, pity there's only one of you...",male
CHECHEN, How you know?,male
CHECHEN, Who's stupid enough steal from us?,male
CHECHEN, Who the hell is that?,male
CHECHEN," You promised safe, clean money launder-",male
CHECHEN, What stops them getting to you?,male
CHECHEN, Sit.  I wanna hear proposition.,male
CHECHEN, What you propose?,male
CHECHEN, How much you want?,male
CHECHEN, I put word out.  We hire the clown. He was right.  We have to fix real problem.  Batman.,male
CHECHEN, Like I say- not so crazy as you look.,male
CHECHEN," More for us.  What you do with all your money, Mr.Joker?",male
CHECHEN, You said you were a man of your word.,male
CHECHEN, They won't work for a freak.,male
CHECHEN, Loose the dogs!,male
BATMAN, I don't need help.,male
BATMAN, Don't let me find you out here again.,male
BATMAN, I'm not wearing hockey pads.,male
BATMAN, Him again.  Who are the others?,male
BATMAN, Some of the marked bills I gave you.,male
BATMAN, Time to move in.,male
BATMAN, One man or the entire mob?  He can wait.,male
BATMAN, Do you trust him?,male
BATMAN," If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?",male
BATMAN, Then you're going to love me.,male
BATMAN, Drop the knife.,male
BATMAN, Let her go.,male
BATMAN, Are you alright?,male
BATMAN, He's safe.,male
BATMAN, I need ten minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.,male
BATMAN, No.  Fingerprints.,male
BATMAN, I want the Joker.,male
BATMAN, I'm counting on it.,male
BATMAN, Where is he?,male
BATMAN, He must have friends.,male
BATMAN, Someone knows where he is.,male
BATMAN, You'd leave a man's life to chance?,male
BATMAN," His name's Schiff, Thomas.  He's a paranoid schizophrenic, a former patient at Arkham.  The kind of mind the Joker attracts.",male
BATMAN, What do expect to learn from him?,male
BATMAN," You're the symbol of hope that I could never be.  Your stand against organized crime is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham for decades.  If anyone saw this, everything would be undone- all the criminals you got off the streets would be released.  And Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.",male
BATMAN, You're going to call a press conference.  Tomorrow morning.,male
BATMAN," No one else will die because of me. Gotham is in your hands, now.",male
BATMAN, You wanted me.  Here I am.,male
BATMAN, Where's Dent?,male
BATMAN, Then why do you want to kill me?,male
BATMAN, You're garbage who kills for money.,male
BATMAN, Where's Dent?,male
BATMAN, I have one rule.,male
BATMAN, Which is?,male
BATMAN, I'm considering it.,male
BATMAN, Them?,male
BATMAN, WHERE ARE THEY?!,male
BATMAN, WHERE ARE THEY?!,male
BATMAN, Dent knew the risks.,male
BATMAN," I'm sorry, Harvey.",male
BATMAN, Beautiful.  Isn't it?,male
BATMAN, And high frequency generator/receiver.,male
BATMAN," I've got to find this man, Lucius.",male
BATMAN, The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person.,male
BATMAN, Trust me.,male
BATMAN, This is the audio sample.,male
BATMAN," If he talks within range of any phone in the city, you'll be able to triangulate his position.",male
BATMAN," When you've finished, type your name to switch it off.",male
BATMAN, Fox?  There's something going on on the ferries...,male
BATMAN, Do you have a location on the Joker?,male
BATMAN, I have the Joker's location-,male
BATMAN, Prewitt building.  Assemble on the building opposite.,male
BATMAN, He likes the view.,male
BATMAN," It's not that simple.  With the Joker, it never is.",male
BATMAN, That won't happen.,male
BATMAN, There's always a catch with him-,male
BATMAN, I need five minutes.  Alone-,male
BATMAN, Fox.  I need picture.,male
BATMAN, Don't.  Move.,male
BATMAN, Where's the detonator?,male
BATMAN, There won't be any fireworks.,male
BATMAN," What were you hoping to prove?  That deep down, we're all as ugly as you?",male
BATMAN, You're alone.,male
BATMAN, No.  But I know how you get these-,male
BATMAN," You'll be in a padded cell, forever.",male
BATMAN, This city just showed you it's full of people ready to believe in good.,male
BATMAN, What did you do?,male
BATMAN, Lucius.  Find Harvey Dent.,male
BATMAN," You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.",male
BATMAN," Nothing fair ever came out of the barrel of a gun, Dent.",male
BATMAN, What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.  We decided to act.  We three.  We knew the risks and we acted as one.  We are all responsible for the consequences.,male
BATMAN, It wasn't.,male
BATMAN, Because you were the best of us.  He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you could fall.,male
BATMAN," But your fooling yourself if you think you're letting chance decide. You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.  So point it at the people who were responsible.  We all acted as one.  Gordon.  Me.  And you.",male
BATMAN, You don't have to-,male
BATMAN, No.  They won't. They can never know what he did.,male
BATMAN, No.  But the Joker cannot win.,male
BATMAN, Gotham needs its true hero.,male
BATMAN," Yes, I can.",male
BATMAN," You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things because I'm not a hero, like Dent.  I killed those people.  That's what I can be.",male
BATMAN, I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.,male
ALFRED, Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt and you can swap not sleeping in a penthouse for not sleeping in a mansion.,male
ALFRED," You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.",male
ALFRED, I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige. Did you get mauled by a tiger?,male
ALFRED, Perhaps you could hire some of them and take weekends off.,male
ALFRED, I know.  But things are improving. Look at the new District Attorney...,male
ALFRED, Are you interested in his character... or his social circle?,male
ALFRED," Well, I trust you're not following me on my day off.",male
ALFRED," Know your limits, Master Wayne.",male
ALFRED," Well, you do, sir.",male
ALFRED, And what happens the day you find out?,male
ALFRED," That day, Master Wayne, even I won't want to.  Probably.",male
ALFRED, I found one.  In Arizona.  Very nice man says it will take him a week to get it running.  And he takes cash. What about a flight crew?,male
ALFRED," Oh, yes.",male
ALFRED, I believe your plane is here.,male
ALFRED, If you can tell me the Russian for 'apply your own bloody suntan lotion.’,male
ALFRED," I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir.",male
ALFRED, I assumed it was your usual reason for socialising beyond myself and the scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try and impress Miss Dawes.,male
ALFRED," A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?",male
ALFRED," Yes, sir.",male
ALFRED," Not yet, sir.",male
ALFRED," Oh, you have no idea.",male
ALFRED," You crossed it first, sir.  You've hammered them, squeezed them to the point of desperation.  And now, in their desperation they've turned to a man they don't fully understand.",male
ALFRED," Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand, either.",male
ALFRED," I was in Burma.  A long time ago.  My friends and I were working for the local government.  They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders, bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.  We were asked to take care of the problem,  so we started looking for the stones.  But after six months, we couldn't find anyone who had traded with him.",male
ALFRED, One day I found a child playing with a ruby as big as a tangerine. The bandit had been throwing the stones away.,male
ALFRED," Because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money... they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.",male
ALFRED," I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.",male
ALFRED," Got one.  Melvin White, aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice- 1502 Randolph Apartments, just off State-",male
ALFRED, Even the logs?,male
ALFRED," Endure, Master Wayne.  Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman... he can be the outcast.  He can make the choice no one else can face.  The right choice.",male
ALFRED," Today, I don't want to. Although I did bloody tell you.",male
ALFRED, I suppose they'll lock me up as well. Your accomplice.,male
ALFRED, I don't know.  He went down to the press conference-,male
ALFRED," Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent believe that Batman stands for something more important than a terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even if everyone hates him for it.",male
ALFRED, How will I know?,male
ALFRED," Goodbye, Rachel.",male
ALFRED, I prepared a little breakfast.,male
ALFRED, Very well.,male
ALFRED," Yes, Master Wayne?",male
ALFRED, You have inspired good.  But you spat in the face of Gotham's criminals- didn't you think there might be casualties?  Things were always going to have to get worse before they got better.,male
ALFRED, Rachel believed in what you stood for.  What we stand for.,male
ALFRED, Gotham needs you.,male
ALFRED," Which is why for now, they'll have to make do with you.",male
ALFRED, It can wait.,male
ALFRED, We burned the forest down.,male
ALFRED, You need to see this.,male
ALFRED, Looking for?,male
ALFRED," Will you be taking the batpod, sir?",male
ALFRED, The Lamborghini then. Much more subtle.,male
ALFRED, Nothing on them.  No immediate family members admitted to a Gotham hospital.,male
ALFRED, Burns is clean... Zachary...,male
ALFRED, When you stitch yourself up you make a bloody mess.,male
WAYNE, But I learn from my mistakes.,male
WAYNE, My armor... I'm carrying too much weight- I need to be faster.,male
WAYNE," A dog. A big dog.  There were more copycats last night, Alfred.  With guns.",male
WAYNE, This wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people.,male
WAYNE, I am.  Closely.  I need to know if he can be trusted.,male
WAYNE, Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.,male
WAYNE," If you ever took one, I might.",male
WAYNE, Batman has no limits.,male
WAYNE, I can't afford to know them.,male
WAYNE, We all know how much you like to say 'I told you so'.,male
WAYNE, OK.  Cancel the deal.,male
WAYNE, I needed a closer look at their books.,male
WAYNE, I need a new suit.,male
WAYNE," I'm not talking about fashion, Mr.Fox, so much as function.",male
WAYNE, Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.,male
WAYNE, Rachel!  Fancy that.,male
WAYNE," Rachel, Natascha.  Natascha, Rachel.",male
WAYNE, I certainly hope not.,male
WAYNE, Let's put a couple tables together.,male
WAYNE, They should!  I own the place.,male
WAYNE, How'd you know?,male
WAYNE, Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.,male
WAYNE," You're into ballet, Harvey?",male
WAYNE, I was raised here.  I turned out OK.,male
WAYNE," The Palisades?  Sure.  You know, as our new D.A. you might want to figure out where your jurisdiction ends.",male
WAYNE, Exactly.  Who appointed the Batman?,male
WAYNE," Well, you've sold me, Dent.  I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.",male
WAYNE," I don't think you understand.  One fundraiser with my pals, you'll never need another cent.",male
WAYNE, I'm sure you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong.,male
WAYNE, I think Mr.Lau deserves a more personal touch.,male
WAYNE, How about getting back into the plane?,male
WAYNE, Without it landing.,male
WAYNE, Sorry.,male
WAYNE," We wouldn't want things getting too easy, would we? How will it hold up against dogs?",male
WAYNE," South Korean smugglers.  They run flights into Pyongyang, below radar the whole way.  Did you think of an alibi?",male
WAYNE," You look tired, Alfred.  Will you be all right without me?",male
WAYNE, How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?,male
WAYNE, What's this?,male
WAYNE, Sonar.  Just like a b-,male
WAYNE, And the other device?,male
WAYNE, How's it going?,male
WAYNE, And why do you think I wanted to hold a party for Harvey Dent?,male
WAYNE, Very droll.  But very wrong. Actually it's Dent.  You see-,male
WAYNE," Sorry, I'm late- glad you started without me!  Where's Rachel?!",male
WAYNE," Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend.  When she told me she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say...  the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials?",male
WAYNE," 'I Believe in Harvey Dent.'  Nice slogan, Harvey.  Certainly caught Rachel's attention.  But then I started paying attention to Harvey, and all he's been doing as our new D.A., and you know what?  I believe in Harvey Dent.  On his watch, Gotham can feel a little safer.  A little more optimistic.  So get out your checkbooks and let's make sure that he stays right where all of Gotham wants him... All except Gotham's criminals, of course.  To the face of Gotham's bright future- Harvey Dent.",male
WAYNE, I meant every word.,male
WAYNE," The day you once told me about, the day when Gotham no longer needs Batman.  It's coming.",male
WAYNE," It's happening now- Harvey is that hero.  He locked up half the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask.  Gotham needs a hero with a face.",male
WAYNE, They've come for him.,male
WAYNE, Stay hidden.,male
WAYNE," Targeting me won't get their money back.  I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight, but this is different.  They've crossed a line.",male
WAYNE," Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just have to figure out what he's after.",male
WAYNE, What were you missing?,male
WAYNE, So why was he stealing them?,male
WAYNE, And here's a thumb print.,male
WAYNE, Yes.  Government telecommunications project.,male
WAYNE, Lucius.  I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.,male
WAYNE, I've run it through all the databases and came up with four possibles.,male
WAYNE, Overlooking the parade.,male
WAYNE, I have no choice.,male
WAYNE," Perhaps not.  But I've got enough blood on my hands.  I've seen, now, what I would have to become to stop men like him.",male
WAYNE, You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...,male
WAYNE, We'd be together.,male
WAYNE, But did you mean it?,male
WAYNE, Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.,male
WAYNE," People are dying, Alfred.  What would you have me do?",male
WAYNE, Today I've found out what Batman can't do.  He can't endure this. Today you get to say 'I told you so'.,male
WAYNE, Accomplice?  I'm going to tell them the whole thing was your idea.,male
WAYNE, Alfred?,male
WAYNE," Did I bring this on us?  On her?  I thought I would inspire good, not madness-",male
WAYNE," But Rachel, Alfred...",male
WAYNE, Gotham needs its hero.  And I let the Joker blow him half to hell-,male
WAYNE, She was going to wait for me.  Dent doesn't know.  He can never know...,male
WAYNE, What's that?,male
WAYNE," That bandit, in the forest in Burma...  Did you catch him? How?",male
WAYNE," I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.",male
WAYNE, Hospital admissions.,male
WAYNE," In the middle of the day?  Not very subtle, Alfred.",male
WAYNE, I saw O'Brien and Richards...,male
WAYNE, I saw Burns and Zachary... and a patrolman I don't know.,male
WAYNE, There's at least one I don't know- send the information to Gordon-,male
WAYNE, Call me Bruce.  I think so.,male
WAYNE, Trying to catch the light?,male
WAYNE, Why?  Who's in it?,male
WAYNE, It can get a little intense.  Think I should go to hospital?,male
WAYNE, That's why I gave it to you.  Only you can use it.,male
DENT," Sorry I'm late, folks.",male
DENT, Worried you'd have to step up?,male
DENT," Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll take it.  Tails, he's all yours.",male
DENT," My father's lucky coin.  As I recall, it got me my first date with you.",male
DENT, I don't. I make my own luck.,male
DENT," Tee-off's 1:30.  More than enough time to put you away for life, Sally.",male
DENT," With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must've stepped up to run the so-called family. Is this man in the courtroom today? Could you identify him for us, please?",male
DENT," I've got a sworn statement from you that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family.",male
DENT, Permission to treat the witness as hostile?,male
DENT," Ceramic 28 caliber.  Made in China. If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.",male
DENT," Glad you're so pleased, Rachel.  I'm fine by the way.",male
DENT, Can't.  I dragged the head of the Major Crimes Unit down here.,male
DENT," Well, good thing about the mob is they keep giving you second chances.",male
DENT, Lightly irradiated bills.  Fancy stuff for a city cop.  Have help?,male
DENT," Save it, Gordon.  I want to meet him.",male
DENT, And that flood light on top of M.C.U.?,male
DENT," I've put every known money launderer in Gotham behind bars.  But the mob is still getting its money out.  I think you and your ""friend"" have found the last game in town and you're trying to hit 'em where it hurts: their wallets.  Bold.  You gonna count me in?",male
DENT," Gordon, I don't like that you've got your own special unit, and I don't like that it's full of cops I investigated at internal affairs.",male
DENT, You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks without telling me who we're after?,male
DENT," Well, that's a start.  I'll get you your warrants.  But I want your trust.",male
DENT, I hear they've got a different nickname for me down at M.C.U..,male
DENT, It took three weeks to get a reservation and I had to tell them I worked for the government.,male
DENT, This city health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.,male
DENT, What?,male
DENT, The famous Bruce Wayne.  Rachel's told me everything about you.,male
DENT, I don't know if they'll let us-,male
DENT, Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?,male
DENT, Gotham's proud of an ordinary man standing up for what's right.,male
DENT, We did.  All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.,male
DENT," When their enemies were at the gate, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city.  It wasn't considered an honor. It was considered public service.",male
DENT," Well, I guess you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  Look, whoever the Batman is, he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life doing this.  How could he?",male
DENT, Maybe.  If I'm up to it.,male
DENT, If I were sneaking out every night someone would've noticed by now.,male
DENT," That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm not up for reelection for three years.  That stuff won't start for-",male
DENT, You're a hard man to reach.,male
DENT," Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd asked, I could have taken his passport- I told you to keep me in the loop.",male
DENT," My office?!  You're sitting down here with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez... Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beef.",male
DENT," We need Lau back, but the Chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.",male
DENT, I'll get him to sing.,male
DENT," I knew the risks when I took this job, lieutenant.  Same as you. How will you get him back, anyway?",male
DENT, I've got it.  RICO.  If their money was pooled we can charge all of them as one criminal conspiracy.,male
DENT, In a RICO case if we can charge any of the conspirators with a felony-,male
DENT," What is this Gordon, your fortress?",male
DENT, I don't trust them here.,male
DENT," It's your call, Lieutenant.  Be right.",male
DENT, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...,male
DENT, ...but I'm sure glad he's back.,male
DENT, I asked Gordon to make some arrests.,male
DENT," She shares my enthusiasm for justice. After all, she is a judge.",male
DENT," It won't matter.  The head guys make bail, sure... but the mid-level guys, they can't, and they can't afford to be off the streets long enough for trial and appeal.  They'll cut deals that include some jail time.  Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.",male
DENT, Rachel-,male
DENT," Thanks.  Alfred, right?",male
DENT, Rachel talks about you all the time. You've known her her whole life?,male
DENT, Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?,male
DENT," You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that.  Thanks again.  Mind if I borrow Rachel?",male
DENT, You cannot leave me on my own with these people.,male
DENT," Compared to this, the mob doesn't scare me.  Although, I will say: them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.",male
DENT, Yeah.  It makes you think about what you couldn't stand losing.  And who you want to spend the rest of your life with...,male
DENT, Not if the mob has their way.,male
DENT, Okay.  Let's be serious.  What's your answer?,male
DENT," I guess no answer isn't ""no"".",male
DENT," It's someone else, isn't it?",male
DENT, Just tell me it's not Wayne.  The guy's a complete-,male
DENT, So where do you keep your trash?,male
DENT, You're due in court- I need you alive long enough to get you on the record.,male
DENT, Refuse to cooperate on the stand- you won't be coming back here- you'll go to county.  How long do you calculate you'll last in there?,male
DENT, Tell me what you know about the Joker.,male
DENT, Where are you?,male
DENT," Rachel, listen to me.  You're not safe there.",male
DENT," Gordon's gone, Rachel.",male
DENT, And he's gone.  The Joker's named you next.,male
DENT," Rachel, I can't let anything happen to you.  I love you too much.",male
DENT," Rachel, I know he's your friend but-",male
DENT, Okay.  Go straight there.  Don't tell anyone where you're going.  I'll find you there.,male
DENT, I love you.,male
DENT, You wanna play games?,male
DENT," No.  I wouldn't.  That's why I'm not going to leave it up to me. Heads- you get to keep your head. Tails... not so lucky.  So, you want to tell me about the Joker?",male
DENT, Go again?,male
DENT," You're not playing the odds, friend.",male
DENT, Not exactly.,male
DENT," The Joker killed Gordon- and, and Loeb.  He's going to kill Rachel...",male
DENT, Why?,male
DENT, You can't!  You can't give in!,male
DENT," Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for coming.  I've called this press conference for two reasons.  Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham that everything that can be done over the Joker killing is being done. Secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in-",male
DENT, But first.  Let's consider the situation: should we give in to this terrorist's demands?  Do we really think that-,male
DENT, The Batman is an outlaw...,male
DENT, Yes.  They are.  But the night is darkest just before the dawn.,male
DENT, So be it. Take the Batman into custody.,male
DENT, I am the Batman.,male
DENT," I'm sorry, I didn't have time to talk this through with you.",male
DENT," They're transferring me to central holding.  This is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, Batman will take him down.",male
DENT, How do you know what he's thinking?,male
DENT, Heads I go through with it.,male
DENT, I'm not.,male
DENT," Lieutenant, you do like to play it pretty close to the chest...",male
DENT," Thanks, detective- I've got a date with a pretty upset fiancée.",male
DENT, Rachel?  Rachel is that you?,male
DENT," It's OK, Rachel.  Everything's going to be just fine.",male
DENT, Can you move your chair?,male
DENT, Look for something to free yourself.,male
DENT, Nothing.  I'm trying to...,male
DENT," Don't think like that, Rachel. They're coming for you.",male
DENT, NO!  Not me... Why did you come for me?!,male
DENT, RACHEL!,male
DENT, RACHEL!!!,male
DENT," Remember the name you all had for me when I was at Internal Affairs?  What was it, Gordon?",male
DENT, SAY IT!,male
DENT, Why should I hide who I am?,male
DENT, Why would you listen to me now?,male
DENT, No.  No you're not.  Not yet.,male
DENT, Your men.  Your plan.,male
DENT, You live.,male
DENT, You die.,male
DENT, Hello.,male
DENT, Half.,male
DENT," Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?",male
DENT," You, of all people, are gonna protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?",male
DENT," Funny, I don't know what's going to happen to you, either.",male
DENT, Going to join your wife?,male
DENT, You love her?,male
DENT, Can you imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?,male
DENT, The Joker's just a mad dog.  I want whoever let him off the leash.,male
DENT," I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit? Who picked up Rachel?  It must've been someone she trusted.",male
DENT, It can't hurt your chances.,male
DENT, I said it couldn't hurt your chances.,male
DENT, Lucky guy.,male
DENT, But he's not.,male
DENT, Your driver.,male
DENT, She believe you?,male
DENT, She trusts you.  Just like Rachel did.,male
DENT," 'What they were gonna do'?  You're the second cop to say that to me. What, exactly, did you think they were going to do?",male
DENT, Don't!,male
DENT," Live to fight another day, officer.",male
DENT, Where my family died.,male
DENT," This is where they brought her, Gordon.  After your people handed her over.  This is where they bound her. This is where she suffered.  This is where she died.",male
DENT," But you didn't, did you?",male
DENT," Yes, you could.",male
DENT, If you'd listened to me- if you'd stood up against corruption instead of doing your deal with the devil.,male
DENT," You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost. Have you ever had to talk to the person you love most, wondering if you're about to listen to them die? You ever had to lie to that person? Tell them it's going to be all right, when you know it's not?  Well, you're about to find out what that feels like.  Then you'll be able to look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.",male
DENT," No, just the person you need most. So is it your wife?",male
DENT, We have a winner.,male
DENT, You brought your cops?,male
DENT, You think I want to escape?!  There's no escape from this-,male
DENT," I've done plenty wrong, Gordon.  Just not quite enough.  Yet.",male
DENT, It's not about what I want.  It's about what's fair. You thought we could be decent men in an indecent world.  You thought we could lead by example.  You thought the rules could be bent but not break... you were wrong.  The world is cruel. And the only morality in a cruel world is chance.  Unbiased. Unprejudiced.  Fair.,male
DENT, His boy's got the same chance she had.  Fifty-fifty.,male
DENT, Then why was it only me who lost everything?,male
DENT, The Joker chose me!,male
DENT, And he was right.,male
DENT, Fair enough.,male
DENT, You first.,male
DENT, My turn.,male
DENT," Your turn, Gordon.",male
DENT," I'm about to.  Tell your son it's going to be all right, Gordon.  Lie. Like I lied.",male
RACHEL, Where were you?,female
RACHEL, I know the briefs backwards.,female
RACHEL, You're flipping coins to see who leads?,female
RACHEL," I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave things like this to chance.",female
RACHEL," We'll never link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him, but I'll tell you one thing- the fact they tried to kill you means we're getting to them.",female
RACHEL," Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if you're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job. 'Course if you said you were rattled we could take the rest of the day...",female
RACHEL, Jim Gordon?  He's a friend- try to be nice.,female
RACHEL, Really?,female
RACHEL," Yes, Bruce.  Fancy that.",female
RACHEL," Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.",female
RACHEL, For how long?  About three weeks?,female
RACHEL," Natascha, aren't you...?",female
RACHEL, Harvey's taking me next week.,female
RACHEL, No.  He knows I am.,female
RACHEL, And the last man they asked to protect the republic was named Caesar.  He never gave up that power.,female
RACHEL, Give us the money and we'll deal.,female
RACHEL, You mean when they hear that you've helped us they're going to kill you?,female
RACHEL," No, I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation. As will everyone. Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.",female
RACHEL, You were a glorified accountant- what could you have on all of them that we could charge?,female
RACHEL, We can charge all of them with it.,female
RACHEL," Mr.Lau, do you have details of this communal fund?  Ledgers, notebooks...?",female
RACHEL," Once you've testified in open court. So with your clients locked up, what happens to all that money?",female
RACHEL," Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld, scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.",female
RACHEL, Harvey may not know you well enough to understand when you're making fun of him.  But I do.,female
RACHEL, You can't ask me to wait for that.,female
RACHEL, The whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?,female
RACHEL," Oh, yeah?",female
RACHEL," The rest of your life, huh?  That's a pretty big commitment.",female
RACHEL, Don't.,female
RACHEL, I don't have an answer.,female
RACHEL," I'm sorry, Harvey.  I just...",female
RACHEL, What are you doing?!,female
RACHEL, Stop!,female
RACHEL," Let's not do that again, okay? Is Harvey-?",female
RACHEL, Thank you.,female
RACHEL," Harvey, where are you?!",female
RACHEL, Where you should be- at Major Crimes trying to sort through all the-,female
RACHEL," This is Gordon's unit, Harvey-",female
RACHEL, He vouched for these men-,female
RACHEL, Bruce.  We can trust Bruce Wayne.,female
RACHEL," Trust me, Harvey, Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.",female
RACHEL, Harvey called.  He says Batman is going to turn himself in.,female
RACHEL, You honestly think it's going to stop the Joker from killing?,female
RACHEL," Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life-",female
RACHEL, Yes.,female
RACHEL, But they won't let us be together after you turn yourself in.,female
RACHEL," Why is he letting Harvey do this, Alfred?",female
RACHEL, And just stood by?!,female
RACHEL," Well, you're right about one thing- letting Harvey take the fall is not heroic.",female
RACHEL," You know Bruce best, Alfred...  give it to him when the time is right.",female
RACHEL, It's not sealed.,female
RACHEL," Goodbye, Alfred.",female
RACHEL," Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.",female
RACHEL, No.  This is too dangerous-,female
RACHEL, He's using you as bait- but he doesn't know if he can get the Joker- he's failed so far.,female
RACHEL," I just do, okay?  Harvey, this isn't just about you, what about all the people counting on you to turn this city around?  Tell everyone the truth-",female
RACHEL, This is your life... you don't leave something like this to chance...,female
RACHEL, You make your own luck.,female
RACHEL, Can anyone hear me?,female
RACHEL, Harvey.  You're OK.  I thought...,female
RACHEL," No.  Harvey, we don't have much time-",female
RACHEL, They said only one of us was going to make it.  That they'd let our... Our friends choose...,female
RACHEL, Harvey?  What's happening?,female
RACHEL," Harvey, in case... I want you to know something...",female
RACHEL," I know, but I don't want them to...",female
RACHEL," I don't want to live without you. Because I do have an answer, and my answer is yes...",female
RACHEL," Harvey?  Harvey, it's okay...",female
RACHEL, Somewhere-,female
MARONI," I thought the DA just played golf with the Mayor, things like that.",male
MARONI, Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap purple suit and make-up.  He's not the problem- he's a nobody. The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.,male
MARONI, So what are you proposing?,male
MARONI, If it's so easy why haven't you done it already?,male
MARONI, How soon can you move the money?,male
MARONI," You sure you want to embarrass me in front of my friends, Lieutenant?",male
MARONI, I don't wanna hear you talk.,male
MARONI," From one professional to another-if you're trying to scare someone, pick a better spot.  From this height the fall wouldn't kill me.",male
MARONI," I don't know, he found us-",male
MARONI, Friends?  You met this guy?,male
MARONI," No one's gonna tell you anything- they're wise to your act- you got rules... the Joker, he's got no rules.  No one's gonna cross him for you.  You want this guy, you got one way.  And you already know what that is.  Just take off that mask and let him come find you.",male
MARONI, Or you want to let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind?,male
MARONI, This craziness.  This is too much.,male
MARONI," You want him, I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.",male
MARONI," Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.",male
MARONI, Yes.,male
MARONI, Take it up with the Joker.  He killed your woman.  Made you... like this...,male
MARONI," If I tell you, will you let me go?",male
MARONI, It was Ramirez.,male
MARONI, But you said-,male
MARONI, Who?,male
DENT," But, your honor, I'm not done...",male
LAU, In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for dynamic new growth.  A joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.,male
LAU," It's OK, Mr.Fox.  Everyone knows who really runs Wayne Enterprises.",male
LAU, I'm told the man who arranged the heist calls himself Joker.,male
LAU, Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed sources we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills and are planning to seize your funds today-,male
LAU," With the investigation ongoing, none of you can risk hanging on to your own proceeds.  And since the enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my competitors out of business, I'm your only option.",male
LAU, Moving all deposits to one secure location.  Not a bank.,male
LAU," Obviously, no one can know but me. If the police were to gain leverage over one of you everyone's money would be at stake.",male
LAU, As the money is moved I go to Hong Kong.  Far from Dent's jurisdiction. And the Chinese will not extradite one of their own.,male
LAU, I already have...,male
LAU, For obvious reasons I couldn't wait for your permission...,male
LAU," Rest assured, your money is safe.",male
LAU, I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations. This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...  I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company.  A businessman of your stature will understand.  But with you here... we can continue.,male
LAU, We do not allow cell phones in-,male
LAU," I think, Mr.Fox, that a simple phone call might have sufficed.",male
LAU, Just accidentally wasting it.,male
LAU, Where the hell are the cops?,male
LAU, What the hell am I paying them for?,male
LAU, The money is the only reason I'm still alive.,male
LAU," Wait. I won't give you the money, but I'll give you my clients.  All of them.",male
LAU, I'm good with calculation- I handled all their investments.  One big pot.,male
LAU," Immunity, protection and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.",male
LAU, Like I said- I'm good with calculation.,male
LAU, No way.  You can't protect me- you can't even protect yourselves.,male
FOX," Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of the board, and Mr.Wayne, in expressing our own excitement...",male
FOX, We'll be in touch as soon as our people have wrapped up the diligence.,male
FOX," You worry about the diligence, Mr. Reese.  I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.",male
FOX," Do it again.  Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, would we?",male
FOX," Another long night? This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it, but I'm not convinced.  L.S.I.'s grown 8 percent annually, like clockwork.  They must have a revenue stream that's off the books.  Maybe even illegal.",male
FOX, You already knew.,male
FOX, Anything else you can trouble me for?,male
FOX, Three buttons is a little nineties.,male
FOX, You want to be able to turn your head?,male
FOX, I'll see what I can do.,male
FOX, Our Chinese friend left town before I could tell him the deal is off.,male
FOX, What's wrong with a phone call?,male
FOX," For high altitude jumps, you need oxygen and stabilizers.  I must say- compared to your usual requests, jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.",male
FOX, I can recommend a good travel agent.,male
FOX," That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.",male
FOX, I don't think I have anything here. The CIA had a program in the '60s for getting their people out of hot spots.  Called Sky Hook.  Now-,male
FOX, Hardened kevlar plates on a titanium- dipped fiber tri-weave for flexibility...,male
FOX," You'll be lighter, faster, more agile...",male
FOX," Perhaps you should read the instructions, first.",male
FOX," Now, there's a trade-off...  the spread of the plates gives you weak spots.  You'll be more vulnerable to gunfire and knives.",male
FOX, You talking chihuahuas or rotweilers? It should do fine against cats.,male
FOX, I understand!,male
FOX," Well, it was good of you to bring me out here in such style, Mr.Lau.  But I've actually come...",male
FOX," Sorry.  Forgot I had it.  So, I've come to explain why we're going to have to put our deal on hold...",male
FOX," We can't afford to be seen to do business with... well, whatever it is you're accused of being.  A businessman of your stature will understand.",male
FOX," Well, I do love Chinese food.  And Mr.Wayne didn't want you to think we'd been deliberately wasting your time.",male
FOX," That's very good- ""accidentally"". Very good.  I'll be sure and tell Mr.Wayne that he was wrong about you not having a sense of humor.",male
FOX, Restricted.  Lau's holed up in there good and tight.  Here...,male
FOX, I had R and D work it up- it sends out high frequencies and records the response time to map an environment.,male
FOX, Submarine.  Like a submarine.,male
FOX, In place.,male
FOX, Mr.Wayne? Good luck.,male
FOX," What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?",male
FOX, Their CEO is in police custody.,male
FOX," Let me get this straight.  You think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands... And now your plan is to blackmail this person?",male
FOX, Good luck.,male
FOX, Here's your original scan...,male
FOX, Here's it reverse-engineered...,male
FOX," I'll make you a copy. Mr.Wayne, did you reassign R and D?",male
FOX, I wasn't aware we had any new government contracts.  Can you-,male
FOX, Fair enough.,male
FOX, Beautiful.  Unethical.  Dangerous. You've turned every phone in the city into a microphone...,male
FOX, Like the phone I gave you in Hong Kong.  You took my sonar concept and applied it to everybody's phone in the City.  With half the city feeding you sonar you can image all of Gotham. This is wrong.,male
FOX, But at what cost?,male
FOX, No one should have that kind of power.,male
FOX, Spying on thirty million people wasn't in my job description.,male
FOX, I'll help you this one time...,male
FOX, But consider this my resignation.,male
FOX," As long as this machine is at Wayne Industries, I won't be.",male
FOX, I'm zeroing in.,male
FOX," His voice is on the ferry, but that's not the source...",male
FOX, It's west...,male
FOX," You've got p.o.v. on alpha channel, omni on beta-",male
REESE," Sir, I know Mr.Wayne's curious how his trust fund gets replenished but frankly... it's embarrassing.",male
REESE, It's done- the numbers are solid.,male
REESE, You asked me to do the diligence on the L.S.I.Holdings deal again.  I found irregularities.,male
REESE," Not with their numbers.  With yours. A whole division of Wayne Industries disappeared, overnight.  So I went down to the archives and started pulling old files.",male
REESE," My kids love the Batman.  I thought he was pretty cool, too.  Out there, kicking some ass.",male
REESE, Changes things when you know it's just a rich kid playing dress up.,male
REESE," Your project.  Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news.  Now you're getting sloppy.  Applied Sciences was a small, dead department- who'd notice?",male
REESE, That's simply not why I'm doing this.,male
REESE, If we could talk to Dent now he might feel differently-,male
REESE, I guess it would depend on the life.,male
REESE, Of course not.,male
REESE, They're trying to kill me.,male
DENT, ~Batman's looking for someone to take up his mantle.,male
DENT," Is there someone, anyone in this city we can trust?",male
DENT," And I promise you, the dawn is coming. One day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken- but to us, not to this madman.",male
LAU," Gentlemen, please. As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.  A relatively small amount: 68 million.",male
FOX, There's a better view from the peak tram.,male
MAYOR," But that means it's on you.  They're all coming after you, now.  Not just the mob... politicians, journalists, cops- anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.  Are you up to it? You better be.  They get anything on you... those criminals will be back on the streets...",male
STEPHENS, Just the normal number of bad guys in the building- and they're all city employees.  Here's a list.,male
STEPHENS," Jim, it's over.",male
STEPHENS, But the prosecution's over.,male
STEPHENS, No-one's standing up in front of a Judge while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.,male
STEPHENS," If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mexico by now.",male
STEPHENS," I'm sorry, Barbara.",male
STEPHENS, I'm sorry.,male
STEPHENS, Switch it off- he ain't coming. He doesn't want to talk to us.  God help whoever he does want to talk to-,male
STEPHENS, That's nice.,male
STEPHENS," I'm a twenty year man.  I can tell the difference between punks who need a little lesson in manners, and the freaks like you who would just enjoy it. And you killed six of my friends.",male
STEPHENS, I know you're going to enjoy this. But I'm going to enjoy it more.,male
STEPHENS, This is my own damn fault.  Just shoot him.,male
REESE," But now you've got the entire R and D department burning cash, claiming it's related to cell phones for the army.  What are you building him now? A rocket ship? I want ten million a year.  For the rest of my life.",male
WAYNE, Cross-reference the addresses. Look for Parkside and around.,male
DENT, But that's not why we're demanding he turn himself in.  We're doing it because we're scared.  We've been happy to let Batman clean up our streets for us until now-,male
DENT," Hello, Jim.",male
DENT, You're about to know what my suffering is really like...,male
ALFRED, That's the sacrifice he's making- to not be a hero.  To be something more.,male
RACHEL," Dear Bruce, I need to explain...",female
RACHEL, ...I need to be honest and clear. I'm going to marry Harvey Dent...,female
RACHEL," I love him, I want to spend the rest of my life with him...",female
RACHEL," When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman we could be together, I meant it...",female
RACHEL, But I'm not sure the day will come...,female
RACHEL," ...when you no longer need Batman.  I hope it does, and if it does I will be there...",female
