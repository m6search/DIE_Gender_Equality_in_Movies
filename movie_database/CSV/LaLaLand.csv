1,MIA," Don’t worry, it is. I know sometimes it --",1,female
2,MIA, Shit.,1,female
3,MIA, It’s -- five past...,1,female
4,MIA, Ok.,1,female
5,MIA, I wanted to give you an entrance.,1,female
6,MIA, Eh...,1,female
7,MIA, I don’t know who Jen and Rachel are.,1,female
8,MIA, I don’t know if they were there.,1,female
9,MIA, Can’t. Working.,1,female
10,MIA, Yes?,1,female
11,MIA, It’ll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses.,1,female
12,MIA," I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --",1,female
13,MIA," No, Jamal. You be trippin’.",1,female
14,MIA, Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...,1,female
15,MIA, “I Ran”.,1,female
16,MIA, “Curt”?,1,female
17,MIA, Ok.,1,female
18,MIA, My God. Did you just call yourself “a serious musician”?,1,female
19,MIA, Can I borrow what you’re wearing?,1,female
20,MIA, Because I have an audition next week. I’m playing a serious fire-fighter.,1,female
21,MIA, Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That’s a classic.,1,female
22,MIA, He just told you what to do.,1,female
23,MIA, Mia.,1,female
24,MIA, George Michael!,1,female
25,MIA, Did you just get your keys?,1,female
26,MIA, Can you grab mine?,1,female
27,MIA, The Prius.,1,female
28,MIA, They are...n’t.,1,female
29,MIA, Strange that we keep running into each other.,1,female
30,MIA, I doubt it.,1,female
31,MIA, What?,1,female
32,MIA, Uh-huh.,1,female
33,MIA, Oh my God.,1,female
34,MIA, Agreed. I’ve seen better.,1,female
35,MIA, ...Ok...,1,female
36,MIA, No...,1,female
37,MIA, I have an audition. Remember?,1,female
38,MIA, But you said --,1,female
39,MIA, ...Hi. What are you doing here?,1,female
40,MIA, Uh-huh. How’d you get on the lot?,1,female
41,MIA, I’m off in ten.,1,female
42,MIA, That’s the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca.,1,female
43,MIA, Yeah. Greg.,1,female
44,MIA, We’ve been seeing each other for a few months.,1,female
45,MIA, Oh yeah?,1,female
46,MIA, A what?,1,female
47,MIA, We need to wait here.,1,female
48,MIA," Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library’s old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. I never knew the world was so big.",1,female
49,MIA," I started putting on plays in my garage. I’d write the scripts and print up programs, and she’d give me props to use from wherever she’d just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she’d jet off again and I wouldn’t hear from her for another year.",1,female
50,MIA, God no -- I didn’t invite anyone. That would have been terrifying.,1,female
51,MIA, Well it doesn’t need more actresses.,1,female
52,MIA," What do you mean, “just an actress”?",1,female
53,MIA, That is not what I said.,1,female
54,MIA, Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.,1,female
55,MIA," Ok, I’ll stop auditioning and make history instead.",1,female
56,MIA, I hate jazz.,1,female
57,MIA, It means when I listen to it I don’t like it.,1,female
58,MIA, I do hate some animals.,1,female
59,MIA, I thought it was just Kenny G.,1,female
60,MIA, I associate it with facials. It’s relaxing.,1,female
61,MIA," Right, but it’s good to talk over. Where I grew up there’s this jazz station they’d play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese.",1,female
62,MIA, Your club?,1,female
63,MIA," Hi, I just missed a call...",1,female
64,MIA, That show I told you about.,1,female
65,MIA, Right. It’s -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.,1,female
66,MIA, Obviously. No.,1,female
67,MIA, It’s the one I lie about.,1,female
68,MIA, ...Ok.,1,female
69,MIA, Ok. For research.,1,female
70,MIA," Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.",1,female
71,MIA, Well -- it’s not picked up yet.,1,female
72,MIA," First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV.",1,female
73,MIA," Well, no, I have a call-back.",1,female
74,MIA, It’s another audition.,1,female
75,MIA, ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.,1,female
76,MIA, Oxygen.,1,female
77,MIA," You know what, I have to go. I love you.",1,female
78,MIA," Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you’d best be ready to get bullied --",1,female
79,MIA, I can do it another way --,1,female
80,MIA, Shit. No. Yes. I’ll change...,1,female
81,MIA, I’m sorry.,1,female
82,MIA, It’s a play. I’m going to put it on myself.,1,female
83,MIA, Actually -- it’s a -- it’s a one-woman show...,1,female
84,MIA, I think so.,1,female
85,MIA, Nice meeting you.,1,female
86,MIA, ...You’re just saying that.,1,female
87,MIA, I don’t know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?,1,female
88,MIA, But do you think people will like it?,1,female
89,MIA, You always say that.,1,female
90,MIA, Fine -- as long as you sit front-row ‘cause I’ll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.,1,female
91,MIA, I made something for you.,1,female
92,MIA, It could be the name design. On the door.,1,female
93,MIA, That’s what you should name it.,1,female
94,MIA," Sebastian, no one’s going to a club called “Chicken on a Stick”.",1,female
95,MIA, No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. And it’s time to start looking for other places.,1,female
96,MIA, Make your own history.,1,female
97,MIA, I’m doing that.,1,female
98,MIA, The one who offered you a gig.,1,female
99,MIA, Why was it weird between you two?,1,female
100,MIA, He did offer you a job.,1,female
101,MIA, Are you going to call him?,1,female
102,MIA, Ok...,1,female
103,MIA," Thanks Harry, I’m good.",1,female
104,MIA, I think today’s San Diego. I’m not sure...,1,female
105,MIA, Nothing...,1,female
106,MIA, I guess. I’m adapting.,1,female
107,MIA, He told me.,1,female
108,MIA, Do you think he’s happy?,1,female
109,MIA," I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.",1,female
110,MIA, Hey it’s me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven’t heard from you in a while... I miss you... Ok... Bye...,1,female
111,MIA, Stay.,1,female
112,MIA, I’m nervous.,1,female
113,MIA, Because... What if people show up?,1,female
114,MIA, I’m nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I’m terrified.,1,female
115,MIA, I can.,1,female
116,MIA, Ugh.,1,female
117,MIA, Boise?,1,female
118,MIA, To Boise?,1,female
119,MIA, Wish I could.,1,female
120,MIA, Come to Boise?,1,female
121,MIA, Because I have to rehearse.,1,female
122,MIA, You mean anywhere you are?,1,female
123,MIA," Well, all my stuff is here and my show’s in a few weeks and -- I don’t know, it doesn’t seem practical...",1,female
124,MIA," I know, but when are you done?",1,female
125,MIA, When are you done with the tour?,1,female
126,MIA, So it’s...the long haul?,1,female
127,MIA," I mean the long haul -- like, you’re going to be in this band for a long time.",1,female
128,MIA," I don’t know, I didn’t think the band would --",1,female
129,MIA," No, that’s not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you’re going to be on the road for -- what, years now?",1,female
130,MIA, Do you like the music you’re playing?,1,female
131,MIA, It matters if you’re going to give up your dream to be on the road for years.,1,female
132,MIA, Yes. I do. I just didn’t think you did.,1,female
133,MIA," And now I hear you’re going to be on the road for years, and I’m --",1,female
134,MIA, What do you mean why am I doing this?,1,female
135,MIA, To be in this band?,1,female
136,MIA," Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club.",1,female
137,MIA, Why aren’t you starting your club?,1,female
138,MIA, Change the name!,1,female
139,MIA," I do like jazz now, because of you.",1,female
140,MIA, People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.,1,female
141,MIA," You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --",1,female
142,MIA, This is not your dream.,1,female
143,MIA, Why do you care so much about being liked -- ?,1,female
144,MIA, Are you kidding?,1,female
145,MIA, Stop --,1,female
146,MIA, It’s over.,1,female
147,MIA, I’m done embarrassing myself.,1,female
148,MIA, No one showed up. I can’t even pay back the theater.,1,female
149,MIA, Not anymore.,1,female
150,MIA, I’m ok.,1,female
151,MIA, I’m good...,1,female
152,MIA, You took down the swing.,1,female
153,MIA, Oh God. Throw those away.,1,female
154,MIA, Why did you come here?,1,female
155,MIA, Ok...,1,female
156,MIA, I know who she is.,1,female
157,MIA, I’m not going.,1,female
158,MIA, I’m -- no... That will kill me.,1,female
159,MIA, Yes.,1,female
160,MIA, I’m happier.,1,female
161,MIA, I told you.,1,female
162,MIA," Because it’s another audition! I’ve been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I’m crying and they start laughing, or I’m one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- -- because --",1,female
163,MIA, Because I’m probably not good enough.,1,female
164,MIA, No. Maybe I’m not.,1,female
165,MIA, Why what?,1,female
166,MIA, ...Because it hurts a little bit too much.,1,female
167,MIA, How did you find me?,1,female
168,MIA, ...Ok.,1,female
169,MIA, ...About...?,1,female
170,MIA," My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once...",1,female
171,MIA, They said the next couple of days... But I’m not expecting to find anything out.,1,female
172,MIA," No, I’m not.",1,female
173,MIA, Where are we?,1,female
174,MIA, I mean -- where are we?,1,female
175,MIA, What do we do?,1,female
176,MIA, If I get this --,1,female
177,MIA, What are you going to do?,1,female
178,MIA, Right.,1,female
179,MIA, You know I’m always going to love you.,1,female
180,MIA, I’ve seen better.,1,female
181,MIA, I’ve never been here during the day.,1,female
182,MIA," Hi... Iced coffee, please.",1,female
183,MIA," No, no, that’s fine.",1,female
184,MIA," Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.",1,female
185,MIA, We can just see it back in New York...,1,female
186,MIA," I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --",1,female
187,MIA, No... We should go.,1,female
188,MIA," Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...",1,female
189,MIA," And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...",1,female
190,MIA," No, no, Turner’s fine. So you -- are you waiting ‘til Denver to tell her...? Oh. I see... No, you’re right. I understand. Ok... I just... Oh...",1,female
191,MIA," No, I’m happy for you... I -- I just --",1,female
192,MIA, No...,1,female
193,MIA, I don’t like the fissure on the GT scan. Did you test for achromatopsia?,1,female
194,MIA," D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.",1,female
195,MIA," This is my classroom. You don’t like it, the door’s to my left.",1,female
196,MIA, The one with the green ribbon.,1,female
197,MIA, Shit...,1,female
198,MIA, Thank you for saving the day back there.,1,female
199,MIA, Eh.,1,female
200,MIA," Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I’m just leaving now... K, see you soon...",1,female
201,MIA, Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car?,1,female
202,MIA, Night.,1,female
203,MIA, I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier.,1,female
204,MIA," Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I’ve tried so hard to want other things.",1,female
205,MIA," I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. Should’ve been a lawyer.",1,female
206,MIA, Anyway -- I’m getting a feeling there’s something I should tell you...,1,female
207,MIA, I got a call-back!,1,female
208,MIA," Hi, Mom!",1,female
209,MIA, I have an idea.,1,female
210,MIA, So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?,1,female
211,MIA, What time do you leave in the morning?,1,female
212,MIA, I’m gonna go home for a while.,1,female
213,MIA, Maybe I’m one of those people who’s always wanted to do it but never had a chance. It’s a pipe dream. Maybe it’s like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.,1,female
214,MIA," I can go back to school. I can find something else that I’m supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn’t work out, and it took six years, and I don’t want to do it anymore.",1,female
215,MIA, Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off here and get dinner?,1,female
246,MIA, No...,1,female
247,MIA," ...No, Mom, it’s a one-woman show... No, I’m acting in it as well... No, I’m not getting paid, I’m paying to do it... He’s great... He’s going to open his own jazz club. It’s going to be incredible... Well he has to get the money together first, and... He’s figuring it out... Yeah, it’s just been a little tricky lately...",1,female
535,MIA, It’s one-way!!,1,female
536,MIA, Look -- he’s going to find a way to open it and you’re going to love it. Ok? How’s Dad?,1,female
220,MANAGER, On us.,1,male
221,MANAGER, Where do you think you’re going?,1,male
222,MANAGER, You’d better be here early tomorrow.,1,male
223,MANAGER, You’re closing up Friday.,1,male
224,MANAGER, Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.,1,male
225,MANAGER, And fix your apron.,1,male
238,ALEXIS, Mia! How’d it go?,1,female
239,ALEXIS, Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?,1,female
240,ALEXIS, They’re the worst.,1,female
241,ALEXIS, I bet they were.,1,female
242,ALEXIS," Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home?",1,female
243,ALEXIS, Mia?,1,female
495,BOSS, Seb.,1,female
496,BOSS, Your welcome. Stick to the set list.,1,female
497,BOSS," I do, and I don’t want to hear the free jazz.",1,female
498,BOSS, ...every goddamned night.,1,female
499,BOSS, Too late. You’re done.,1,female
500,BOSS, Do you think anyone here gives a shit?,1,female
507,CUSTOMER, Are these pastries gluten-free?,1,male
508,CUSTOMER, What?? I want a refund.,1,male
523,GREG," Hey... I’m parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed.",1,male
524,GREG, It’s ok.,1,male
525,GREG," Oh, sure --",1,male
526,GREG, I’ve never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing?,1,male
527,GREG, Mia?,1,male
537,KEITH," Holy shit. Come here, man.",1,male
538,KEITH, So how’ve you been?,1,male
539,KEITH, Keeping busy. Got a new combo.,1,male
540,KEITH, ...Looking for keys.,1,male
541,KEITH, You sure? It pays.,1,male
542,KEITH, Let’s just grab a drink then. Call me. It’s been too long.,1,male
543,KEITH," Nice meeting you, Mia.",1,male
544,KEITH, Sebastian.,1,male
545,KEITH," Here’s the deal. We’ve got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We’re about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?",1,male
546,KEITH," Let’s play, see how it feels.",1,male
547,KEITH," I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn’t as good as you. But you’re a pain in the ass, man.",1,male
548,KEITH," You good for tonight, right?",1,male
549,KEITH, Seven. The photo shoot. Mojo.,1,male
550,KEITH, No. It’s tonight.,1,male
551,KEITH, Didn’t know if I’d see you today.,1,male
552,KEITH, Sebastian?,1,male
553,KEITH, I know. It’s different.,1,male
554,KEITH," But you say you want to save jazz. How are you going to save jazz if no one’s listening? Jazz wouldn’t exist if people hadn’t gotten tired of what they were listening to before. I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. If traditionalists had their way, we’d still be playing Dixieland.",1,male
555,KEITH," If it’s not your thing, just let me know. I don’t want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it’s not. But if you want it -- the job’s yours.",1,male

572,AUDIENCE MEMBER #1," I swear to God, if I have to hear one more hipster waxing nostalgic I’m gonna slit my wrists.",1,female

580,MIAS DAD, You want some more rice?,1,male
581,MIAS DAD, You look hungry.,1,male
582,MIAS DAD, It’s fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten.,1,male
583,MIAS DAD, She made me.,1,male
584,MIAS DAD, Never.,1,male
585,MIAS DAD, I’ve still got all your old tapes.,1,male

226,CASTING DIRECTOR, ...I’ll call her back. Tell her I’m almost done in here.,1,male
227,CASTING DIRECTOR, You know what? I think we’re good. Thanks for coming in.,1,male
248,SEBASTIAN, You gotta stop breaking into my home.,1,male
249,SEBASTIAN, Please don’t sit on that.,1,male
250,SEBASTIAN, Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.,1,male
251,SEBASTIAN, Don’t need it.,1,male
252,SEBASTIAN, That’s almost insulting... Did he?,1,male
253,SEBASTIAN, When I unpack them in my club.,1,male
254,SEBASTIAN, No.,1,male
255,SEBASTIAN, Who wants to tapas while they samba?,1,male
256,SEBASTIAN, I don’t want to meet anyone.,1,male
257,SEBASTIAN, Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?,1,male
258,SEBASTIAN, Then what are we gonna talk about?,1,male
259,SEBASTIAN," Ok. Then I have someone I’d like you to meet. He’s got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold.",1,male
260,SEBASTIAN, How long’s it been?,1,male
261,SEBASTIAN, I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It’s not my fault I got Shanghai’ed.,1,male
262,SEBASTIAN, What’s the difference?,1,male
263,SEBASTIAN, Why do you say romantic like it’s a dirty word?,1,male
264,SEBASTIAN," You’re acting like life’s got me on the ropes -- what you don’t understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I’m letting life hit me ‘til it gets tired. Then I’m gonna make my move. It’s a classic rope-a-dope.",1,male
265,SEBASTIAN, I’m changing the locks.,1,male
266,SEBASTIAN, I’m a phoenix rising from the ashes!,1,male
267,SEBASTIAN, Bill. Thanks for having me back.,1,male
268,SEBASTIAN, Of course. Though I don’t think they care what I play.,1,male
269,SEBASTIAN," How ‘bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal.",1,male
270,SEBASTIAN, There’s a nice way to say that.,1,male
271,SEBASTIAN," I’ll stick to the set list, I promise --",1,male
272,SEBASTIAN, You’re not gonna find a better player. You know that.,1,male
273,SEBASTIAN, Ok. I remember you.,1,male
274,SEBASTIAN, Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.,1,male
275,SEBASTIAN, But requesting “I Ran” from a serious musician -- it’s too far.,1,male
276,SEBASTIAN, I don’t think so.,1,male
277,SEBASTIAN, Why?,1,male
278,SEBASTIAN, So you’re an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything?,1,male
279,SEBASTIAN," Oh, you’re a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there.",1,male
280,SEBASTIAN, He doesn’t tell me what to do.,1,male
281,SEBASTIAN, I let him.,1,male
282,SEBASTIAN, Mia. Guess I’ll see you in the movies.,1,male
283,SEBASTIAN, You again.,1,male
284,SEBASTIAN, ...Yeah.,1,male
285,SEBASTIAN, ...Which one is it?,1,male
286,SEBASTIAN, Those look comfortable.,1,male
287,SEBASTIAN, You didn’t give me much of a choice.,1,male
288,SEBASTIAN, It is strange. Maybe it means something.,1,male
289,SEBASTIAN, Yeah I don’t think so either.,1,male
290,SEBASTIAN," It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly.",1,male
291,SEBASTIAN," You don’t live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out.",1,male
292,SEBASTIAN, Not much to look at.,1,male
293,SEBASTIAN," No, that’s fine... Thanks...",1,male
294,SEBASTIAN, Meetings. Studio heads.,1,male
295,SEBASTIAN, Piece of cake.,1,male
296,SEBASTIAN, Great. I’ll hide in the bathroom.,1,male
297,SEBASTIAN, What’s your Bogart’s name...? Is it Greg?,1,male
298,SEBASTIAN, How long have...?,1,male
299,SEBASTIAN, I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out  of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.,1,male
300,SEBASTIAN, It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. It’s a samba-tapas place now.,1,male
301,SEBASTIAN, Samba-tapas. It’s... Exactly. The joke’s on history.,1,male
302,SEBASTIAN, I know. They shoot movies on my street. “C-stands.” “Apple box.” “Don’t forget to sign out.”,1,male
303,SEBASTIAN, How’d you get into all this?,1,male
304,SEBASTIAN, Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?,1,male
305,SEBASTIAN, ...‘Cause the world needs more lawyers.,1,male
306,SEBASTIAN, You’re not just an actress.,1,male
307,SEBASTIAN," You said it yourself, you’re a child- prodigy playwright.",1,male
308,SEBASTIAN, You’re too modest to say it but it’s true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that’s as interesting as you are.,1,male
309,SEBASTIAN, All I’m saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.,1,male
310,SEBASTIAN, Yeah?,1,male
311,SEBASTIAN, What does that mean? “I hate jazz”?,1,male
312,SEBASTIAN, But it’s such a blanket statement. It’s like saying “I hate animals”.,1,male
313,SEBASTIAN, Do you need to be anywhere right now?,1,male
314,SEBASTIAN, ...What?,1,male
315,SEBASTIAN, It’s not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight ‘cause somebody told him he played a wrong note!,1,male
316,SEBASTIAN, Mia. These are things you can’t unsay.,1,male
317,SEBASTIAN, ...It’s gonna be the old Van Beek. I’m getting the lease back. It’ll be perfect.,1,male
318,SEBASTIAN, Really? For what?,1,male
319,SEBASTIAN, Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?,1,male
320,SEBASTIAN, That’s amazing! “I got the bulletsssss!”,1,male
321,SEBASTIAN, What? You’re the movie person.,1,male
322,SEBASTIAN, Come on. You can’t do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me’s playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.,1,male
323,SEBASTIAN, 10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?,1,male
324,SEBASTIAN, Keith?,1,male
325,SEBASTIAN," This is Mia. Mia, Keith. We used to play together.",1,male
326,SEBASTIAN, Great. You?,1,male
327,SEBASTIAN, Good for you.,1,male
328,SEBASTIAN, I’m good.,1,male
329,SEBASTIAN, I’m good.,1,male
330,SEBASTIAN, You bet.,1,male
331,SEBASTIAN, It’s beautiful.,1,male
332,SEBASTIAN, No... I’m not.,1,male
333,SEBASTIAN, That’s the point.,1,male
334,SEBASTIAN, Fuck ‘em.,1,male
335,SEBASTIAN, I truly believe it.,1,male
336,SEBASTIAN, I’ll be front-row.,1,male
337,SEBASTIAN, What’s that?,1,male
338,SEBASTIAN, Why does it say “Seb’s”?,1,male
339,SEBASTIAN, Never.,1,male
340,SEBASTIAN, You don’t get it. Charlie Parker got the name “Bird” because he loved chicken. So my club’s gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. “Chicken on a Stick”.,1,male
341,SEBASTIAN, It’s gotta be Van Beek. I can’t let them samba all over its history.,1,male
342,SEBASTIAN, Your play’s incredible.,1,male
343,SEBASTIAN, ...Which guy?,1,male
344,SEBASTIAN, You mean Keith? He’s the worst.,1,male
345,SEBASTIAN, It’s always weird with him.,1,male
346,SEBASTIAN, Right...,1,male
347,SEBASTIAN, No.,1,male
348,SEBASTIAN, Here’s what we know. It’s definitely Chicken on a Stick -- -- and your play is going to be a triumph.,1,male
349,SEBASTIAN, Well... Here I am.,1,male
350,SEBASTIAN," Yeah, that...that... ...sounds good.",1,male
351,SEBASTIAN, You’re holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future.,1,male
352,SEBASTIAN, Surprise.,1,male
353,SEBASTIAN, How’s the play going?,1,male
354,SEBASTIAN, Why?,1,male
355,SEBASTIAN, Fuck ‘em!,1,male
356,SEBASTIAN, They should be so lucky to see it. It’s going to be incredible. I can’t wait.,1,male
357,SEBASTIAN, 6:45.,1,male
358,SEBASTIAN, Yep. Boise.,1,male
359,SEBASTIAN, You should come.,1,male
360,SEBASTIAN," Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list.",1,male
361,SEBASTIAN, Why can’t you?,1,male
362,SEBASTIAN, Yeah.,1,male
363,SEBASTIAN, Can’t you rehearse anywhere?,1,male
364,SEBASTIAN, ...I -- I guess...,1,male
365,SEBASTIAN, Right... I just -- we’re going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other.,1,male
366,SEBASTIAN, ...What do you mean?,1,male
367,SEBASTIAN," But -- as soon as we’re done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour.",1,male
368,SEBASTIAN, ...What does that mean?,1,male
369,SEBASTIAN, What did you think I was going to do?,1,male
370,SEBASTIAN, You didn’t think we’d be successful.,1,male
371,SEBASTIAN," Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record.",1,male
372,SEBASTIAN, I don’t know how that matters.,1,male
373,SEBASTIAN, Do you like the music I’m playing?,1,male
374,SEBASTIAN," Yeah, well, I --",1,male
375,SEBASTIAN, What are you doing? Why are you doing this?,1,male
376,SEBASTIAN, This is what you wanted from me.,1,male
377,SEBASTIAN, To have a steady job.,1,male
378,SEBASTIAN, So I’m doing that. So why aren’t we celebrating?,1,male
379,SEBASTIAN, You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick --,1,male
380,SEBASTIAN, -- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.,1,male
381,SEBASTIAN, What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing “Jingle Bells” so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?,1,male
382,SEBASTIAN, Not in my experience.,1,male
383,SEBASTIAN, This is the dream!,1,male
384,SEBASTIAN, Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that’s liked. I’m finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?,1,male
385,SEBASTIAN," You’re an actress, who are you to talk??",1,male
386,SEBASTIAN, No.,1,male
387,SEBASTIAN, ...Tonight?,1,male
388,SEBASTIAN, I thought that was next Thursday.,1,male
389,SEBASTIAN, Mia!,1,male
390,SEBASTIAN, I’m -- I’m sorry I missed it -- and I’m sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I’ll make it up to you --,1,male
391,SEBASTIAN, ...What do you mean?,1,male
392,SEBASTIAN, You didn’t embarrass yourself...,1,male
393,SEBASTIAN, ...This is home.,1,male
394,SEBASTIAN," Oh God, I didn’t see them.",1,male
395,SEBASTIAN, You look beautiful. I hope it was ok. I haven’t played in a while.,1,male
396,SEBASTIAN, Yes ma’am.,1,male
397,SEBASTIAN, ...You still think New York?,1,male
398,SEBASTIAN, What...?,1,male
399,SEBASTIAN, Wrong number.,1,male
400,SEBASTIAN," Yeah, well...not anymore.",1,male
401,SEBASTIAN, I won’t.,1,male
402,SEBASTIAN, ”Casting”...?,1,male
403,SEBASTIAN, Because I have good news.,1,male
404,SEBASTIAN, Amy Brandt. The casting director.,1,male
405,SEBASTIAN, She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she’s got.,1,male
406,SEBASTIAN, ...Excuse me?,1,male
407,SEBASTIAN, That’s it?,1,male
408,SEBASTIAN, So you’re happy here?,1,male
409,SEBASTIAN, Why won’t you come?,1,male
410,SEBASTIAN, I don’t buy it.,1,male
411,SEBASTIAN, Because what?,1,male
412,SEBASTIAN, Yes you are.,1,male
413,SEBASTIAN, Why?,1,male
414,SEBASTIAN, Why don’t you want to do it anymore?,1,male
415,SEBASTIAN, I told them you’d be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I’ll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you’ll be outside or you won’t.,1,male
416,SEBASTIAN, The house across from the library.,1,male
417,SEBASTIAN, When do you find out?,1,male
418,SEBASTIAN, You’re going to get it.,1,male
419,SEBASTIAN, You are. I know these things.,1,male
420,SEBASTIAN, Griffith Park.,1,male
421,SEBASTIAN, I know... I don’t know.,1,male
422,SEBASTIAN, I don’t think we can do anything. Because when you get this --,1,male
423,SEBASTIAN, When you get this -- you’ve got to give it everything you’ve got.,1,male
424,SEBASTIAN, I’ve got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know...,1,male
425,SEBASTIAN, I guess we’re just going to have to wait and see.,1,male
426,SEBASTIAN, I’m always going to love you too.,1,male
427,SEBASTIAN, Agreed.,1,male
428,SEBASTIAN," Alright, I’m done. Harris did a nice job with it.",1,male
429,SEBASTIAN, No one touches the instruments. Carson’s coming an hour early to test levels.,1,male
430,SEBASTIAN, How’d we do last month?,1,male
431,SEBASTIAN, Not too bad is great. See you tonight.,1,male
432,SEBASTIAN, Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?,1,male
433,SEBASTIAN," Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?",1,male
434,SEBASTIAN," Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. I don’t know, I told him to play “Jingle Bells”.",1,male
467,SEBASTIAN, They’ve turned it into a tapas-samba place. You believe that?,1,male
468,SEBASTIAN, And I’m sorry if I was curt that night.,1,male
469,SEBASTIAN, What’s your name?,1,male
470,SEBASTIAN, Put the clicker under your chin.,1,male
471,SEBASTIAN, Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. You got a break coming up?,1,male
472,SEBASTIAN," Anyway, that’s L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing.",1,male
473,SEBASTIAN," Most people say they hate jazz because they don’t have context. They don’t get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other.",1,male
474,SEBASTIAN, It’s not cocktail music -- it’s a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once.,1,male
475,SEBASTIAN, That’s why you need to be in the space and see what’s at stake. This whole thing -- it’s dying. In twenty minutes they’ll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages ‘cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they’ll play whatever they want.,1,male
476,SEBASTIAN, The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music’s had its moment. But I love it too much. I’m not moving on.,1,male
477,SEBASTIAN, So?,1,male
478,SEBASTIAN," You’ve seen it, right?",1,male
479,SEBASTIAN, The whole world from your bedroom? Who’s doing that?,1,male
480,SEBASTIAN, Where’s the piano?,1,male
481,SEBASTIAN, And... There’s twenty-five pounds of apples in it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good.,1,male
482,SEBASTIAN, I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you.,1,male
483,SEBASTIAN, Feels so good to be home.,1,male
484,SEBASTIAN, You’re nervous about what they think?,1,male
485,SEBASTIAN," We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record.",1,male
486,SEBASTIAN," Anyway -- it’s time to grow up. You know? This is what I’m doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would’ve said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line.",1,male
487,SEBASTIAN, Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself.,1,male
488,SEBASTIAN, Wait --,1,male
489,SEBASTIAN, I’m sorry --,1,male
490,SEBASTIAN, It’s your dream.,1,male
491,SEBASTIAN, You’re going to be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now.,1,male
492,SEBASTIAN, Right?,1,male
493,SEBASTIAN, Look at this view.,1,male
494,SEBASTIAN, Welcome to Seb’s.,1,male
501,CARLO, They say I have a knack for world-building.,1,male
502,CARLO, ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it.,1,male
509,DIRECTOR, Cut!,1,NaN
510,DIRECTOR, ...We’ll be seeing you very soon.,1,NaN
520,DIRECTOR, Whenever you’re ready.,1,NaN
521,DIRECTOR, Thanks.,1,NaN
522,DIRECTOR," No, thanks, that was great.",1,NaN
528,JOSH," That’s right -- but now we’ve got a surround-sound set-up, so it’s like --",1,male
529,JOSH," It’s better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days --",1,male
530,JOSH," -- they’re so dirty, and they’re either too hot or too cold, and there’s always people talking, which is just -- -- just so annoying, I mean you’re trying to watch a movie -- one second -- Hello?...",1,male
531,JOSH," Yeah, I’ll have to call you back. So, yeah, we love it.",1,male
532,JOSH, Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable.,1,male
565,HARRY," Hey. I’m grabbing some pastries, you two want anything?",1,male
566,HARRY," Oh, right -- I’ll eat it I guess.",1,male
574,AUDIENCE MEMBER #2, Seriously.,1,female
575,AUDIENCE MEMBER #2, Christ... Don’t quit your day job...,1,female
587,AMY BRANDT," I’m Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.",1,female
588,AMY BRANDT, So why don’t you just tell us a story?,1,female

591,AMY BRANDT, Whenever you’re ready.,1,female

229,TRACY," Two minutes, people! Mia you’re coming, right?",1,female
230,TRACY," Look, I know things didn’t go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you’re perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you’re coming.",1,female
231,TRACY, Exactly. Fun.,1,female
232,TRACY, Lex! I’m disappointed in you. There’s nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest.,1,female
233,TRACY," There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo’s a writer.",1,female
234,TRACY, ...Is that gonna happen every time?,1,female
235,TRACY, Ever heard of a vent?,1,female
236,TRACY, It’ll be fun.,1,female
237,TRACY, Is that a script?,1,female
244,TRACY, What? Did she say “working”?,1,female
245,TRACY, What’s that?,1,female
435,LAURA, You think Mom or Dad would call this a home?,1,male
436,LAURA, Are you serious?,1,male
437,LAURA, I wonder why. I brought you this. It’s a throw rug.,1,male
438,LAURA, Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?,1,male
439,LAURA, When are you going to unpack these boxes?,1,male
440,LAURA," Oh my God. It’s like a girl broke up with you and you’re stalking her. You’re not still going by there, are you?",1,male
441,LAURA, Seb --,1,male
442,LAURA, I have someone I want you to meet.,1,male
443,LAURA, You’ll like her.,1,male
444,LAURA, Probably not.,1,male
445,LAURA, You’ll talk about the weather.,1,male
446,LAURA, Sebastian --,1,male
447,LAURA, You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You’re driving without insurance.,1,male
448,LAURA," You did not get “Shanghai’ed”, you got ripped off.",1,male
449,LAURA, It’s not as romantic as that. And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you.,1,male
450,LAURA, Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.,1,male
451,LAURA, I love you. Unpack your boxes.,1,male
452,LAURA, You can’t afford it.,1,male
453,LAURA, Look at him -- watch --,1,male
454,LAURA, Same here but I think someone’s trying to break into your car.,1,male
455,LAURA," You should come over tonight. Harry’s cooking, but don’t let that stop you. What’s the matter?",1,male
456,LAURA, You miss him.,1,male
457,LAURA, I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other.,1,male
458,LAURA, I wasn’t looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... You’ve changed Seb. You know that?,1,male
459,LAURA, Is he happy?,1,male
460,LAURA," Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he’d play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I’m happy for him.",1,male
461,LAURA, No -- I changed my mind.,1,male
462,LAURA, You remember the McKenzies?,1,male
